The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata tells of events leading up to the present Age of Kali. It was at the beginning of this age, some fifty centuries ago, that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to His friend and devotee Arjuna.\n\nTheir discourse \u2013 one of the greatest philosophical and religious dialogues known to man \u2013 took place just before the onset of war, a great fratricidal conflict between the hundred sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and on the opposing side their cousins the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, or sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du.\n\nDh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du were brothers born in the Kuru dynasty, descending from King Bharata, a former ruler of the earth, from whom the name Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata derives. Because Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, the elder brother, was born blind, the throne that otherwise would have been his was passed down to the younger brother, P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du.\n\nWhen P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du died at an early age, his five children \u2013 Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Bh\u012bma, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva \u2013 came under the care of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, who in effect became, for the time being, the king. Thus the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and those of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du grew up in the same royal household. Both were trained in the military arts by the expert Dro\u1e47a and counseled by the revered \u201cgrandfather\u201d of the clan, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma.\n\nYet the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, especially the eldest, Duryodhana, hated and envied the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. And the blind and weak-minded Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra wanted his own sons, not those of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, to inherit the kingdom.\n\nThus Duryodhana, with Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s consent, plotted to kill the young sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, and it was only by the careful protection of their uncle Vidura and their cousin Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas escaped the many attempts against their lives.\n\nNow, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not an ordinary man but the Supreme Godhead Himself, who had descended to earth and was playing the role of a prince in a contemporary dynasty. In this role He was also the nephew of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du\u2019s wife Kunt\u012b, or P\u1e5bth\u0101, the mother of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. So both as a relative and as the eternal upholder of religion, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favored the righteous sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du and protected them.\n\nUltimately, however, the clever Duryodhana challenged the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas to a gambling match. In the course of that fateful tournament, Duryodhana and his brothers took possession of Draupad\u012b, the chaste and devoted wife of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and insultingly tried to strip her naked before the entire assembly of princes and kings. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s divine intervention saved her, but the gambling, which was rigged, cheated the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas of their kingdom and forced them into thirteen years of exile.\n\nUpon returning from exile, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas rightfully requested their kingdom from Duryodhana, who bluntly refused to yield it. Duty-bound as princes to serve in public administration, the five P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas reduced their request to a mere five villages. But Duryodhana arrogantly replied that he wouldn\u2019t spare them enough land into which to drive a pin.\n\nThroughout all this, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas had been consistently tolerant and forbearing. But now war seemed inevitable.\n\nNonetheless, as the princes of the world divided, some siding with the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, others with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself took the role of messenger for the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du and went to the court of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra to plead for peace. When His pleas were refused, war was now certain.\n\nThe P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, men of the highest moral stature, recognized K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the impious sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra did not. Yet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a offered to enter the war according to the desire of the antagonists. As God, He would not personally fight; but whoever so desired might avail himself of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s army \u2013 and the other side could have K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, as an advisor and helper. Duryodhana, the political genius, snatched at K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s armed forces, while the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were equally eager to have K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself.\n\nIn this way, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a became the charioteer of Arjuna, taking it upon Himself to drive the fabled bowman\u2019s chariot. This brings us to the point at which Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 begins, with the two armies arrayed, ready for combat, and Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra anxiously inquiring of his secretary Sa\u00f1jaya, \u201cWhat did they do?\u201d\n\nThe scene is set, with only the need for a brief note regarding this translation and commentary.\n\nThe general pattern translators have followed in rendering Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 into English has been to brush aside the person K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to make room for their own concepts and philosophies. The history of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is taken as quaint mythology, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes a poetic device for presenting the ideas of some anonymous genius, or at best He becomes a minor historical personage.\n\nBut the person K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is both the goal and the substance of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, so far as the G\u012bt\u0101 speaks of itself.\n\nThis translation, then, and the commentary that accompanies it propose to direct the reader to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a rather than away from Him. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 thus becomes wholly consistent and comprehensible. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the speaker of the G\u012bt\u0101, and its ultimate goal as well, the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is presents this great scripture in its true terms.\n\nThe Publishers"}, {"name": "Dedication", "link": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/dedication/advanced-view", "verses": [], "desc": ""}, {"name": "Preface", "link": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/preface/advanced-view", "verses": [], "desc": "Originally I wrote Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is in the form in which it is presented now. When this book was first published, the original manuscript was, unfortunately, cut short to less than 400 pages, without illustrations and without explanations for most of the original verses of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. In all of my other books \u2013 \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, \u015ar\u012b \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad, etc. \u2013 the system is that I give the original verse, its English transliteration, word-for-word Sanskrit-English equivalents, translations and purports. This makes the book very authentic and scholarly and makes the meaning self-evident. I was not very happy, therefore, when I had to minimize my original manuscript. But later on, when the demand for Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is considerably increased, I was requested by many scholars and devotees to present the book in its original form. Thus the present attempt is to offer the original manuscript of this great book of knowledge with full parampar\u0101 explanation in order to establish the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement more soundly and progressively.\n\nOur K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is genuine, historically authorized, natural and transcendental due to its being based on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is. It is gradually becoming the most popular movement in the entire world, especially amongst the younger generation. It is becoming more and more interesting to the older generation also. Older gentlemen are becoming interested, so much so that the fathers and grandfathers of my disciples are encouraging us by becoming life members of our great society, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In Los Angeles many fathers and mothers used to come to see me to express their feelings of gratitude for my leading the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement throughout the entire world. Some of them said that it is greatly fortunate for the Americans that I have started the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement in America. But actually the original father of this movement is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, since it was started a very long time ago but is coming down to human society by disciplic succession. If I have any credit in this connection, it does not belong to me personally, but it is due to my eternal spiritual master, His Divine Grace O\u1e41 Vi\u1e63\u1e47up\u0101da Paramaha\u1e41sa Parivr\u0101jak\u0101c\u0101rya 108 \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012bmad Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Prabhup\u0101da.\n\nIf personally I have any credit in this matter, it is only that I have tried to present Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is, without any adulteration. Before my presentation of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is, almost all the English editions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 were introduced to fulfill someone\u2019s personal ambition. But our attempt, in presenting Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is, is to present the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Our business is to present the will of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not that of any mundane speculator like the politician, philosopher or scientist, for they have very little knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, despite all their other knowledge. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakto mad-y\u0101j\u012b m\u0101\u1e41 namaskuru, etc., we, unlike the so-called scholars, do not say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His inner spirit are different. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is absolute, and there is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s form, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s qualities, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes, etc. This absolute position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is difficult to understand for any person who is not a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the system of parampar\u0101 (disciplic succession). Generally the so-called scholars, politicians, philosophers and sv\u0101m\u012bs, without perfect knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, try to banish or kill K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when writing commentary on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Such unauthorized commentary upon Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is known as m\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da-bh\u0101\u1e63ya, and Lord Caitanya has warned us about these unauthorized men. Lord Caitanya clearly says that anyone who tries to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b point of view will commit a great blunder. The result of such a blunder will be that the misguided student of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 will certainly be bewildered on the path of spiritual guidance and will not be able to go back to home, back to Godhead.\n\nOur only purpose is to present this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is in order to guide the conditioned student to the same purpose for which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends to this planet once in a day of Brahm\u0101, or every 8,600,000,000 years. This purpose is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and we have to accept it as it is; otherwise there is no point in trying to understand the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and its speaker, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first spoke Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to the sun-god some hundreds of millions of years ago. We have to accept this fact and thus understand the historical significance of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, without misinterpretation, on the authority of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. To interpret Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 without any reference to the will of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the greatest offense. In order to save oneself from this offense, one has to understand the Lord as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as He was directly understood by Arjuna, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s first disciple. Such understanding of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is really profitable and authorized for the welfare of human society in fulfilling the mission of life.\n\nThe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is essential in human society, for it offers the highest perfection of life. How this is so is explained fully in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Unfortunately, mundane wranglers have taken advantage of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to push forward their demonic propensities and mislead people regarding right understanding of the simple principles of life. Everyone should know how God, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is great, and everyone should know the factual position of the living entities. Everyone should know that a living entity is eternally a servant and that unless one serves K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one has to serve illusion in different varieties of the three modes of material nature and thus wander perpetually within the cycle of birth and death; even the so-called liberated M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b speculator has to undergo this process. This knowledge constitutes a great science, and each and every living being has to hear it for his own interest.\n\nPeople in general, especially in this Age of Kali, are enamored by the external energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they wrongly think that by advancement of material comforts every man will be happy. They have no knowledge that the material or external nature is very strong, for everyone is strongly bound by the stringent laws of material nature. A living entity is happily the part and parcel of the Lord, and thus his natural function is to render immediate service to the Lord. By the spell of illusion one tries to be happy by serving his personal sense gratification in different forms which will never make him happy. Instead of satisfying his own personal material senses, he has to satisfy the senses of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life. The Lord wants this, and He demands it. One has to understand this central point of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is teaching the whole world this central point, and because we are not polluting the theme of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is, anyone seriously interested in deriving benefit by studying the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 must take help from the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement for practical understanding of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 under the direct guidance of the Lord. We hope, therefore, that people will derive the greatest benefit by studying Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is as we have presented it here, and if even one man becomes a pure devotee of the Lord, we shall consider our attempt a success.\n\nA.

It is the essence of Vedic knowledge and one of the most important Upani\u1e63ads in Vedic literature. Of course there are many commentaries in English on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and one may question the necessity for another one. This present edition can be explained in the following way. Recently an American lady asked me to recommend an English translation of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Of course in America there are so many editions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 available in English, but as far as I have seen, not only in America but also in India, none of them can be strictly said to be authoritative because in almost every one of them the commentator has expressed his own opinions without touching the spirit of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is.\n\nThe spirit of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 itself. It is just like this: If we want to take a particular medicine, then we have to follow the directions written on the label. We cannot take the medicine according to our own whim or the direction of a friend. It must be taken according to the directions on the label or the directions given by a physician. Similarly, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should be taken or accepted as it is directed by the speaker Himself. The speaker of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is mentioned on every page of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagav\u0101n. Of course the word bhagav\u0101n sometimes refers to any powerful person or any powerful demigod, and certainly here bhagav\u0101n designates Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a great personality, but at the same time we should know that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as is confirmed by all great \u0101c\u0101ryas (spiritual masters) like \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, Nimb\u0101rka Sv\u0101m\u012b, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and many other authorities of Vedic knowledge in India. The Lord Himself also establishes Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and He is accepted as such in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and all the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, especially the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, known as the Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a (k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam). Therefore we should take Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is directed by the Personality of Godhead Himself. In the Fourth Chapter of the G\u012bt\u0101 (4.1\u20133) the Lord says:\n\nHere the Lord informs Arjuna that this system of yoga, the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, was first spoken to the sun-god, and the sun-god explained it to Manu, and Manu explained it to Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, and in that way, by disciplic succession, one speaker after another, this yoga system has been coming down. But in the course of time it has become lost. Consequently the Lord has to speak it again, this time to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra.\n\nHe tells Arjuna that He is relating this supreme secret to him because Arjuna is His devotee and His friend. The purport of this is that Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is a treatise which is especially meant for the devotee of the Lord. There are three classes of transcendentalists, namely the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, the yog\u012b and the bhakta, or the impersonalist, the meditator and the devotee. Here the Lord clearly tells Arjuna that He is making him the first receiver of a new parampar\u0101 (disciplic succession) because the old succession was broken. It was the Lord\u2019s wish, therefore, to establish another parampar\u0101 in the same line of thought that was coming down from the sun-god to others, and it was His wish that His teaching be distributed anew by Arjuna. He wanted Arjuna to become the authority in understanding the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. So we see that Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is instructed to Arjuna especially because Arjuna was a devotee of the Lord, a direct student of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and His intimate friend. Therefore Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is best understood by a person who has qualities similar to Arjuna\u2019s. That is to say he must be a devotee in a direct relationship with the Lord. As soon as one becomes a devotee of the Lord, he also has a direct relationship with the Lord. That is a very elaborate subject matter, but briefly it can be stated that a devotee is in a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in one of five different ways:\n\n1. One may be a devotee in a passive state;\n\n2. One may be a devotee in an active state;\n\n3. One may be a devotee as a friend;\n\n4. One may be a devotee as a parent;\n\n5. One may be a devotee as a conjugal lover.\n\nArjuna was in a relationship with the Lord as friend. Of course there is a gulf of difference between this friendship and the friendship found in the material world. This is transcendental friendship, which cannot be had by everyone. Of course everyone has a particular relationship with the Lord, and that relationship is evoked by the perfection of devotional service. But in the present status of our life, not only have we forgotten the Supreme Lord, but we have forgotten our eternal relationship with the Lord. Every living being, out of the many, many billions and trillions of living beings, has a particular relationship with the Lord eternally. That is called svar\u016bpa. By the process of devotional service, one can revive that svar\u016bpa, and that stage is called svar\u016bpa-siddhi \u2013 perfection of one\u2019s constitutional position. So Arjuna was a devotee, and he was in touch with the Supreme Lord in friendship.\n\nHow Arjuna accepted this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should be noted. His manner of acceptance is given in the Tenth Chapter (10.12\u201314):\n\n\u201cArjuna said: You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the ultimate abode, the purest, the Absolute Truth. You are the eternal, transcendental, original person, the unborn, the greatest. All the great sages such as N\u0101rada, Asita, Devala and Vy\u0101sa confirm this truth about You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me. O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I totally accept as truth all that You have told me. Neither the demigods nor the demons, O Lord, can understand Your personality.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as para\u1e41 brahma, the Supreme Brahman. Every living being is Brahman, but the supreme living being, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the Supreme Brahman. Para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma means that He is the supreme rest or abode of everything; pavitram means that He is pure, untainted by material contamination; puru\u1e63am means that He is the supreme enjoyer; \u015b\u0101\u015bvatam, eternal; divyam, transcendental; \u0101di-devam, the original Supreme Personality of Godhead; ajam, the unborn; and vibhum, the greatest.\n\nNow one may think that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was the friend of Arjuna, Arjuna was telling Him all this by way of flattery, but Arjuna, just to drive out this kind of doubt from the minds of the readers of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, substantiates these praises in the next verse when he says that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead not only by himself but by authorities like N\u0101rada, Asita, Devala and Vy\u0101sadeva. These are great personalities who distribute the Vedic knowledge as it is accepted by all \u0101c\u0101ryas. Therefore Arjuna tells K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that he accepts whatever He says to be completely perfect. Sarvam etad \u1e5bta\u1e41 manye: \u201cI accept everything You say to be true.\u201d Arjuna also says that the personality of the Lord is very difficult to understand and that He cannot be known even by the great demigods. This means that the Lord cannot even be known by personalities greater than human beings. So how can a human being understand Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without becoming His devotee?\n\nTherefore Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should be taken up in a spirit of devotion. One should not think that he is equal to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nor should he think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an ordinary personality or even a very great personality. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So according to the statements of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or the statements of Arjuna, the person who is trying to understand the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, we should at least theoretically accept \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and with that submissive spirit we can understand the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Unless one reads the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in a submissive spirit, it is very difficult to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, because it is a great mystery.\n\nJust what is the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101? The purpose of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is to deliver mankind from the nescience of material existence. Every man is in difficulty in so many ways, as Arjuna also was in difficulty in having to fight the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. Arjuna surrendered unto \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and consequently this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was spoken. Not only Arjuna, but every one of us is full of anxieties because of this material existence. Our very existence is in the atmosphere of nonexistence. Actually we are not meant to be threatened by nonexistence. Our existence is eternal. But somehow or other we are put into asat. Asat refers to that which does not exist.\n\nOut of so many human beings who are suffering, there are a few who are actually inquiring about their position, as to what they are, why they are put into this awkward position and so on. Unless one is awakened to this position of questioning his suffering, unless he realizes that he doesn\u2019t want suffering but rather wants to make a solution to all suffering, then one is not to be considered a perfect human being. Humanity begins when this sort of inquiry is awakened in one\u2019s mind. In the Brahma-s\u016btra this inquiry is called brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101. Ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101. Every activity of the human being is to be considered a failure unless he inquires about the nature of the Absolute. Therefore those who begin to question why they are suffering or where they came from and where they shall go after death are proper students for understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The sincere student should also have a firm respect for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a student was Arjuna.\n\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends specifically to reestablish the real purpose of life when man forgets that purpose. Even then, out of many, many human beings who awaken, there may be one who actually enters the spirit of understanding his position, and for him this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is spoken. Actually we are all swallowed by the tigress of nescience, but the Lord is very merciful upon living entities, especially human beings. To this end He spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, making His friend Arjuna His student.\n\nBeing an associate of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna was above all ignorance, but Arjuna was put into ignorance on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra just to question Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a about the problems of life so that the Lord could explain them for the benefit of future generations of human beings and chalk out the plan of life. Then man could act accordingly and perfect the mission of human life.\n\nThe subject of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 entails the comprehension of five basic truths. First of all the science of God is explained, and then the constitutional position of the living entities, j\u012bvas. There is \u012b\u015bvara, which means the controller, and there are j\u012bvas, the living entities which are controlled. If a living entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he is insane. The living being is controlled in every respect, at least in his conditioned life. So in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the subject matter deals with the \u012b\u015bvara, the supreme controller, and the j\u012bvas, the controlled living entities. Prak\u1e5bti (material nature) and time (the duration of existence of the whole universe or the manifestation of material nature) and karma (activity) are also discussed. The cosmic manifestation is full of different activities. All living entities are engaged in different activities. From Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we must learn what God is, what the living entities are, what prak\u1e5bti is, what the cosmic manifestation is, how it is controlled by time, and what the activities of the living entities are.\n\nOut of these five basic subject matters in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is established that the Supreme Godhead, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Brahman, or the supreme controller, or Param\u0101tm\u0101 \u2013 you may use whatever name you like \u2013 is the greatest of all. The living beings are in quality like the supreme controller. For instance, the Lord has control over the universal affairs of material nature, as will be explained in the later chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Material nature is not independent. She is acting under the directions of the Supreme Lord. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram: \u201cThis material nature is working under My direction.\u201d When we see wonderful things happening in the cosmic nature, we should know that behind this cosmic manifestation there is a controller. Nothing could be manifested without being controlled. It is childish not to consider the controller. For instance, a child may think that an automobile is quite wonderful to be able to run without a horse or other animal pulling it, but a sane man knows the nature of the automobile\u2019s engineering arrangement. He always knows that behind the machinery there is a man, a driver. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the driver under whose direction everything is working. Now the j\u012bvas, or the living entities, have been accepted by the Lord, as we will note in the later chapters, as His parts and parcels. A particle of gold is also gold, a drop of water from the ocean is also salty, and similarly we the living entities, being part and parcel of the supreme controller, \u012b\u015bvara, or Bhagav\u0101n, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, have all the qualities of the Supreme Lord in minute quantity because we are minute \u012b\u015bvaras, subordinate \u012b\u015bvaras. We are trying to control nature, as presently we are trying to control space or planets, and this tendency to control is there because it is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But although we have a tendency to lord it over material nature, we should know that we are not the supreme controller. This is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\nWhat is material nature? This is also explained in the G\u012bt\u0101 as inferior prak\u1e5bti, inferior nature. The living entity is explained as the superior prak\u1e5bti. Prak\u1e5bti is always under control, whether inferior or superior. Prak\u1e5bti is female, and she is controlled by the Lord just as the activities of a wife are controlled by the husband. Prak\u1e5bti is always subordinate, predominated by the Lord, who is the predominator. The living entities and material nature are both predominated, controlled by the Supreme Lord. According to the G\u012bt\u0101, the living entities, although parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are to be considered prak\u1e5bti. This is clearly mentioned in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Apareyam itas tv any\u0101\u1e41 prak\u1e5bti\u1e41 viddhi me par\u0101m/ j\u012bva-bh\u016bt\u0101m: \u201cThis material nature is My inferior prak\u1e5bti, but beyond this is another prak\u1e5bti \u2013 j\u012bva-bh\u016bt\u0101m, the living entities.\u201d\n\nMaterial nature itself is constituted by three qualities: the mode of goodness, the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance. Above these modes there is eternal time, and by a combination of these modes of nature and under the control and purview of eternal time there are activities, which are called karma. These activities are being carried out from time immemorial, and we are suffering or enjoying the fruits of our activities. For instance, suppose I am a businessman and have worked very hard with intelligence and have amassed a great bank balance. Then I am an enjoyer. But then say I have lost all my money in business; then I am a sufferer. Similarly, in every field of life we enjoy the results of our work, or we suffer the results. This is called karma.\n\n\u012a\u015bvara (the Supreme Lord), j\u012bva (the living entity), prak\u1e5bti (nature), k\u0101la (eternal time) and karma (activity) are all explained in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Out of these five, the Lord, the living entities, material nature and time are eternal. The manifestation of prak\u1e5bti may be temporary, but it is not false. Some philosophers say that the manifestation of material nature is false, but according to the philosophy of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or according to the philosophy of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, this is not so. The manifestation of the world is not accepted as false; it is accepted as real, but temporary. It is likened unto a cloud which moves across the sky, or the coming of the rainy season, which nourishes grains. As soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud goes away, all the crops which were nourished by the rain dry up. Similarly, this material manifestation takes place at a certain interval, stays for a while and then disappears. Such are the workings of prak\u1e5bti. But this cycle is working eternally. Therefore prak\u1e5bti is eternal; it is not false. The Lord refers to this as \u201cMy prak\u1e5bti.\u201d This material nature is the separated energy of the Supreme Lord, and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the Supreme Lord, although they are not separated but eternally related. So the Lord, the living entity, material nature and time are all interrelated and are all eternal. However, the other item, karma, is not eternal. The effects of karma may be very old indeed. We are suffering or enjoying the results of our activities from time immemorial, but we can change the results of our karma, or our activity, and this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge. We are engaged in various activities. Undoubtedly we do not know what sort of activities we should adopt to gain relief from the actions and reactions of all these activities, but this is also explained in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\nThe position of \u012b\u015bvara, the Supreme Lord, is that of supreme consciousness. The j\u012bvas, or the living entities, being parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are also conscious. Both the living entity and material nature are explained as prak\u1e5bti, the energy of the Supreme Lord, but one of the two, the j\u012bva, is conscious. The other prak\u1e5bti is not conscious. That is the difference. Therefore the j\u012bva-prak\u1e5bti is called superior because the j\u012bva has consciousness which is similar to the Lord\u2019s. The Lord\u2019s is supreme consciousness, however, and one should not claim that the j\u012bva, the living entity, is also supremely conscious. The living being cannot be supremely conscious at any stage of his perfection, and the theory that he can be so is a misleading theory. Conscious he may be, but he is not perfectly or supremely conscious.\n\nThe distinction between the j\u012bva and the \u012b\u015bvara will be explained in the Thirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord is k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a, conscious, as is the living being, but the living being is conscious of his particular body, whereas the Lord is conscious of all bodies. Because He lives in the heart of every living being, He is conscious of the psychic movements of the particular j\u012bvas. We should not forget this. It is also explained that the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is living in everyone\u2019s heart as \u012b\u015bvara, as the controller, and that He is giving directions for the living entity to act as he desires. The living entity forgets what to do. First of all he makes a determination to act in a certain way, and then he is entangled in the actions and reactions of his own karma. After giving up one type of body, he enters another type of body, as we take off and put on clothes. As the soul thus migrates, he suffers the actions and reactions of his past activities. These activities can be changed when the living being is in the mode of goodness, in sanity, and understands what sort of activities he should adopt. If he does so, then all the actions and reactions of his past activities can be changed. Consequently, karma is not eternal. Therefore we stated that of the five items (\u012b\u015bvara, j\u012bva, prak\u1e5bti, time and karma) four are eternal, whereas karma is not eternal.\n\nThe supreme conscious \u012b\u015bvara is similar to the living entity in this way: both the consciousness of the Lord and that of the living entity are transcendental. It is not that consciousness is generated by the association of matter. That is a mistaken idea. The theory that consciousness develops under certain circumstances of material combination is not accepted in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Consciousness may be pervertedly reflected by the covering of material circumstances, just as light reflected through colored glass may appear to be a certain color, but the consciousness of the Lord is not materially affected. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25. When He descends into the material universe, His consciousness is not materially affected. If He were so affected, He would be unfit to speak on transcendental matters as He does in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One cannot say anything about the transcendental world without being free from materially contaminated consciousness. So the Lord is not materially contaminated. Our consciousness, at the present moment, however, is materially contaminated. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 teaches that we have to purify this materially contaminated consciousness. In pure consciousness, our actions will be dovetailed to the will of the \u012b\u015bvara, and that will make us happy. It is not that we have to cease all activities. Rather, our activities are to be purified, and purified activities are called bhakti. Activities in bhakti appear to be like ordinary activities, but they are not contaminated. An ignorant person may see that a devotee is acting or working like an ordinary man, but such a person with a poor fund of knowledge does not know that the activities of the devotee or of the Lord are not contaminated by impure consciousness or matter. They are transcendental to the three modes of nature. We should know, however, that at this point our consciousness is contaminated.\n\nWhen we are materially contaminated, we are called conditioned. False consciousness is exhibited under the impression that I am a product of material nature. This is called false ego. One who is absorbed in the thought of bodily conceptions cannot understand his situation. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was spoken to liberate one from the bodily conception of life, and Arjuna put himself in this position in order to receive this information from the Lord. One must become free from the bodily conception of life; that is the preliminary activity for the transcendentalist. One who wants to become free, who wants to become liberated, must first of all learn that he is not this material body. Mukti, or liberation, means freedom from material consciousness. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also the definition of liberation is given. Muktir hitv\u0101nyath\u0101-r\u016bpa\u1e41 svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25: mukti means liberation from the contaminated consciousness of this material world and situation in pure consciousness. All the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 are intended to awaken this pure consciousness, and therefore we find at the last stage of the G\u012bt\u0101\u2019s instructions that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is asking Arjuna whether he is now in purified consciousness. Purified consciousness means acting in accordance with the instructions of the Lord. This is the whole sum and substance of purified consciousness. Consciousness is already there because we are part and parcel of the Lord, but for us there is the affinity of being affected by the inferior modes. But the Lord, being the Supreme, is never affected. That is the difference between the Supreme Lord and the small individual souls.\n\nWhat is this consciousness? This consciousness is \u201cI am.\u201d Then what am I? In contaminated consciousness \u201cI am\u201d means \u201cI am the lord of all I survey. I am the enjoyer.\u201d The world revolves because every living being thinks that he is the lord and creator of the material world. Material consciousness has two psychic divisions. One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the enjoyer. But actually the Supreme Lord is both the creator and the enjoyer, and the living entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is neither the creator nor the enjoyer, but a cooperator. He is the created and the enjoyed. For instance, a part of a machine cooperates with the whole machine; a part of the body cooperates with the whole body. The hands, legs, eyes and so on are all parts of the body, but they are not actually the enjoyers. The stomach is the enjoyer. The legs move, the hands supply food, the teeth chew, and all parts of the body are engaged in satisfying the stomach because the stomach is the principal factor that nourishes the body\u2019s organization. Therefore everything is given to the stomach. One nourishes the tree by watering its root, and one nourishes the body by feeding the stomach, for if the body is to be kept in a healthy state, then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the enjoyer and the creator, and we, as subordinate living beings, are meant to cooperate to satisfy Him. This cooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomach will help all other parts of the body. If the fingers of the hand think that they should take the food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach, then they will be frustrated. The central figure of creation and of enjoyment is the Supreme Lord, and the living entities are cooperators. By cooperation they enjoy. The relation is also like that of the master and the servant. If the master is fully satisfied, then the servant is satisfied. Similarly, the Supreme Lord should be satisfied, although the tendency to become the creator and the tendency to enjoy the material world are there also in the living entities because these tendencies are there in the Supreme Lord who has created the manifested cosmic world.\n\nWe shall find, therefore, in this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the complete whole is comprised of the supreme controller, the controlled living entities, the cosmic manifestation, eternal time and karma, or activities, and all of these are explained in this text. All of these taken completely form the complete whole, and the complete whole is called the Supreme Absolute Truth. The complete whole and the complete Absolute Truth are the complete Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All manifestations are due to His different energies. He is the complete whole.\n\nIt is also explained in the G\u012bt\u0101 that impersonal Brahman is also subordinate to the complete Supreme Person (brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham). Brahman is more explicitly explained in the Brahma-s\u016btra to be like the rays of the sunshine. The impersonal Brahman is the shining rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonal Brahman is incomplete realization of the absolute whole, and so also is the conception of Param\u0101tm\u0101. In the Fifteenth Chapter it shall be seen that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Puru\u1e63ottama, is above both impersonal Brahman and the partial realization of Param\u0101tm\u0101. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 begins in this way: \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25/ an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am. \u201cGovinda, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the cause of all causes. He is the primal cause, and He is the very form of eternity, knowledge and bliss.\u201d Impersonal Brahman realization is the realization of His sat (eternity) feature. Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization is the realization of sat-cit (eternal knowledge). But realization of the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is realization of all the transcendental features: sat, cit and \u0101nanda (eternity, knowledge and bliss) in complete vigraha (form).\n\nPeople with less intelligence consider the Supreme Truth to be impersonal, but He is a transcendental person, and this is confirmed in all Vedic literatures. Nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13). As we are all individual living beings and have our individuality, the Supreme Absolute Truth is also, in the ultimate issue, a person, and realization of the Personality of Godhead is realization of all of the transcendental features in His complete form. The complete whole is not formless. If He is formless, or if He is less than any other thing, then He cannot be the complete whole. The complete whole must have everything within our experience and beyond our experience, otherwise it cannot be complete.\n\nThe complete whole, the Personality of Godhead, has immense potencies (par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate). How K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is acting in different potencies is also explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. This phenomenal world or material world in which we are placed is also complete in itself because the twenty-four elements of which this material universe is a temporary manifestation, according to S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, are completely adjusted to produce complete resources which are necessary for the maintenance and subsistence of this universe. There is nothing extraneous, nor is there anything needed. This manifestation has its own time fixed by the energy of the supreme whole, and when its time is complete, these temporary manifestations will be annihilated by the complete arrangement of the complete. There is complete facility for the small complete units, namely the living entities, to realize the complete, and all sorts of incompleteness are experienced due to incomplete knowledge of the complete. So Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 contains the complete knowledge of Vedic wisdom.\n\nAll Vedic knowledge is infallible, and Hindus accept Vedic knowledge to be complete and infallible. For example, cow dung is the stool of an animal, and according to sm\u1e5bti, or Vedic injunction, if one touches the stool of an animal he has to take a bath to purify himself. But in the Vedic scriptures cow dung is considered to be a purifying agent. One might consider this to be contradictory, but it is accepted because it is Vedic injunction, and indeed by accepting this, one will not commit a mistake; subsequently it has been proved by modern science that cow dung contains all antiseptic properties. So Vedic knowledge is complete because it is above all doubts and mistakes, and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the essence of all Vedic knowledge.\n\nVedic knowledge is not a question of research. Our research work is imperfect because we are researching things with imperfect senses. We have to accept perfect knowledge which comes down, as is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, by the parampar\u0101 (disciplic succession). We have to receive knowledge from the proper source in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual master, the Lord Himself, and handed down to a succession of spiritual masters. Arjuna, the student who took lessons from Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, accepts everything that He says without contradicting Him. One is not allowed to accept one portion of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and not another. No. We must accept Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 without interpretation, without deletion and without our own whimsical participation in the matter. The G\u012bt\u0101 should be taken as the most perfect presentation of Vedic knowledge. Vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources, and the first words were spoken by the Lord Himself. The words spoken by the Lord are called apauru\u1e63eya, meaning that they are different from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected with four defects. A mundaner (1) is sure to commit mistakes, (2) is invariably illusioned, (3) has the tendency to cheat others and (4) is limited by imperfect senses. With these four imperfections, one cannot deliver perfect information of all-pervading knowledge.\n\nVedic knowledge is not imparted by such defective living entities. It was imparted unto the heart of Brahm\u0101, the first created living being, and Brahm\u0101 in his turn disseminated this knowledge to his sons and disciples, as he originally received it from the Lord. The Lord is p\u016br\u1e47am, all-perfect, and there is no possibility of His becoming subjected to the laws of material nature. One should therefore be intelligent enough to know that the Lord is the only proprietor of everything in the universe and that He is the original creator, the creator of Brahm\u0101. In the Eleventh Chapter the Lord is addressed as prapit\u0101maha because Brahm\u0101 is addressed as pit\u0101maha, the grandfather, and He is the creator of the grandfather. So no one should claim to be the proprietor of anything; one should accept only things set aside for him by the Lord as his quota for his maintenance.\n\nThere are many examples given of how we are to utilize those things which are set aside for us by the Lord. This is also explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. In the beginning, Arjuna decided that he should not fight in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. This was his own decision. Arjuna told the Lord that it was not possible for him to enjoy the kingdom after killing his own kinsmen. This decision was based on the body because he was thinking that the body was himself and that his bodily relations or expansions were his brothers, nephews, brothers-in-law, grandfathers and so on. Therefore he wanted to satisfy his bodily demands. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was spoken by the Lord just to change this view, and at the end Arjuna decides to fight under the directions of the Lord when he says, kari\u1e63ye vacana\u1e41 tava: \u201cI shall act according to Your word.\u201d\n\nIn this world men are not meant for quarreling like cats and dogs. Men must be intelligent to realize the importance of human life and refuse to act like ordinary animals. A human being should realize the aim of his life, and this direction is given in all Vedic literatures, and the essence is given in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Vedic literature is meant for human beings, not for animals. Animals can kill other living animals, and there is no question of sin on their part, but if a man kills an animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste, he must be responsible for breaking the laws of nature. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly explained that there are three kinds of activities according to the different modes of nature: the activities of goodness, of passion and of ignorance. Similarly, there are three kinds of eatables also: eatables in goodness, passion and ignorance. All of this is clearly described, and if we properly utilize the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, then our whole life will become purified, and ultimately we will be able to reach the destination which is beyond this material sky.\n\nThat destination is called the san\u0101tana sky, the eternal, spiritual sky (yad gatv\u0101 na nivartante tad dh\u0101ma parama\u1e41 mama). In this material world we find that everything is temporary. It comes into being, stays for some time, produces some by-products, dwindles and then vanishes. That is the law of the material world, whether we use as an example this body, or a piece of fruit or anything. But beyond this temporary world there is another world of which we have information. That world consists of another nature, which is san\u0101tana, eternal. The j\u012bva is also described as san\u0101tana, eternal, and the Lord is also described as san\u0101tana in the Eleventh Chapter. We have an intimate relationship with the Lord, and because we are all qualitatively one \u2013 the san\u0101tana-dh\u0101ma, or sky, the san\u0101tana Supreme Personality and the san\u0101tana living entities \u2013 the whole purpose of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is to revive our san\u0101tana occupation, or san\u0101tana-dharma, which is the eternal occupation of the living entity. We are temporarily engaged in different activities, but all of these activities can be purified when we give up all these temporary activities and take up the activities which are prescribed by the Supreme Lord. That is called our pure life.\n\nThe Supreme Lord and His transcendental abode are both san\u0101tana, as are the living entities, and the combined association of the Supreme Lord and the living entities in the san\u0101tana abode is the perfection of human life. The Lord is very kind to the living entities because they are His sons. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a declares in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, sarva-yoni\u1e63u\u00a0\u2026\u00a0aha\u1e41 b\u012bja-prada\u1e25 pit\u0101: \u201cI am the father of all.\u201d Of course there are all types of living entities according to their various karmas, but here the Lord claims that He is the father of all of them. Therefore the Lord descends to reclaim all of these fallen, conditioned souls, to call them back to the san\u0101tana eternal sky so that the san\u0101tana living entities may regain their eternal san\u0101tana positions in eternal association with the Lord. The Lord comes Himself in different incarnations, or He sends His confidential servants as sons or His associates or \u0101c\u0101ryas to reclaim the conditioned souls.\n\nTherefore, san\u0101tana-dharma does not refer to any sectarian process of religion. It is the eternal function of the eternal living entities in relationship with the eternal Supreme Lord. San\u0101tana-dharma refers, as stated previously, to the eternal occupation of the living entity. \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya has explained the word san\u0101tana as \u201cthat which has neither beginning nor end,\u201d so when we speak of san\u0101tana-dharma, we must take it for granted on the authority of \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya that it has neither beginning nor end.\n\nThe English word religion is a little different from san\u0101tana-dharma. Religion conveys the idea of faith, and faith may change. One may have faith in a particular process, and he may change this faith and adopt another, but san\u0101tana-dharma refers to that activity which cannot be changed. For instance, liquidity cannot be taken from water, nor can heat be taken from fire. Similarly, the eternal function of the eternal living entity cannot be taken from the living entity. San\u0101tana-dharma is eternally integral with the living entity. When we speak of san\u0101tana-dharma, therefore, we must take it for granted on the authority of \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya that it has neither beginning nor end. That which has neither end nor beginning must not be sectarian, for it cannot be limited by any boundaries. Those belonging to some sectarian faith will wrongly consider that san\u0101tana-dharma is also sectarian, but if we go deeply into the matter and consider it in the light of modern science, it is possible for us to see that san\u0101tana-dharma is the business of all the people of the world \u2013 nay, of all the living entities of the universe.\n\nNon-san\u0101tana religious faith may have some beginning in the annals of human history, but there is no beginning to the history of san\u0101tana-dharma, because it remains eternally with the living entities. Insofar as the living entities are concerned, the authoritative \u015b\u0101stras state that the living entity has neither birth nor death. In the G\u012bt\u0101 it is stated that the living entity is never born and he never dies. He is eternal and indestructible, and he continues to live after the destruction of his temporary material body. In reference to the concept of san\u0101tana-dharma, we must try to understand the concept of religion from the Sanskrit root meaning of the word. Dharma refers to that which is constantly existing with a particular object. We conclude that there is heat and light along with the fire; without heat and light, there is no meaning to the word fire. Similarly, we must discover the essential part of the living being, that part which is his constant companion. That constant companion is his eternal quality, and that eternal quality is his eternal religion.\n\nWhen San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b asked \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu about the svar\u016bpa of every living being, the Lord replied that the svar\u016bpa, or constitutional position, of the living being is the rendering of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If we analyze this statement of Lord Caitanya\u2019s, we can easily see that every living being is constantly engaged in rendering service to another living being. A living being serves other living beings in various capacities. By doing so, the living entity enjoys life. The lower animals serve human beings as servants serve their master. A serves B master, B serves C master, and C serves D master and so on. Under these circumstances, we can see that one friend serves another friend, the mother serves the son, the wife serves the husband, the husband serves the wife and so on. If we go on searching in this spirit, it will be seen that there is no exception in the society of living beings to the activity of service. The politician presents his manifesto for the public to convince them of his capacity for service. The voters therefore give the politician their valuable votes, thinking that he will render valuable service to society. The shopkeeper serves the customer, and the artisan serves the capitalist. The capitalist serves the family, and the family serves the state in the terms of the eternal capacity of the eternal living being. In this way we can see that no living being is exempt from rendering service to other living beings, and therefore we can safely conclude that service is the constant companion of the living being and that the rendering of service is the eternal religion of the living being.\n\nYet man professes to belong to a particular type of faith with reference to particular time and circumstance and thus claims to be a Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or an adherent of any other sect. Such designations are non\u2013san\u0101tana-dharma. A Hindu may change his faith to become a Muslim, or a Muslim may change his faith to become a Hindu, or a Christian may change his faith and so on. But in all circumstances the change of religious faith does not affect the eternal occupation of rendering service to others. The Hindu, Muslim or Christian in all circumstances is a servant of someone. Thus, to profess a particular type of faith is not to profess one\u2019s san\u0101tana-dharma. The rendering of service is san\u0101tana-dharma.\n\nFactually we are related to the Supreme Lord in service. The Supreme Lord is the supreme enjoyer, and we living entities are His servitors. We are created for His enjoyment, and if we participate in that eternal enjoyment with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we become happy. We cannot become happy otherwise. It is not possible to be happy independently, just as no one part of the body can be happy without cooperating with the stomach. It is not possible for the living entity to be happy without rendering transcendental loving service unto the Supreme Lord.\n\nIn the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, worship of different demigods or rendering service to them is not approved. It is stated in the Seventh Chapter, twentieth verse:\n\n\u201cThose whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures.\u201d Here it is plainly said that those who are directed by lust worship the demigods and not the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When we mention the name K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we do not refer to any sectarian name. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a means the highest pleasure, and it is confirmed that the Supreme Lord is the reservoir or storehouse of all pleasure. We are all hankering after pleasure. \u0100nanda-mayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t (Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra 1.1.12). The living entities, like the Lord, are full of consciousness, and they are after happiness. The Lord is perpetually happy, and if the living entities associate with the Lord, cooperate with Him and take part in His association, then they also become happy.\n\nThe Lord descends to this mortal world to show His pastimes in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, which are full of happiness. When Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, His activities with His cowherd boyfriends, with His damsel friends, with the other inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and with the cows were all full of happiness. The total population of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana knew nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a even discouraged His father Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja from worshiping the demigod Indra, because He wanted to establish the fact that people need not worship any demigod. They need only worship the Supreme Lord, because their ultimate goal is to return to His abode.\n\nThe abode of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Fifteenth Chapter, sixth verse:\n\n\u201cThat supreme abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by fire or electricity. Those who reach it never return to this material world.\u201d\n\nThis verse gives a description of that eternal sky. Of course we have a material conception of the sky, and we think of it in relationship to the sun, moon, stars and so on, but in this verse the Lord states that in the eternal sky there is no need for the sun nor for the moon nor electricity or fire of any kind because the spiritual sky is already illuminated by the brahma-jyotir, the rays emanating from the Supreme Lord. We are trying with difficulty to reach other planets, but it is not difficult to understand the abode of the Supreme Lord. This abode is referred to as Goloka. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.37) it is beautifully described: goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25. The Lord resides eternally in His abode Goloka, yet He can be approached from this world, and to this end the Lord comes to manifest His real form, sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha. When He manifests this form, there is no need for our imagining what He looks like. To discourage such imaginative speculation, He descends and exhibits Himself as He is, as \u015ay\u0101masundara. Unfortunately, the less intelligent deride Him because He comes as one of us and plays with us as a human being. But because of this we should not consider the Lord one of us. It is by His omnipotency that He presents Himself in His real form before us and displays His pastimes, which are replicas of those pastimes found in His abode.\n\nIn the effulgent rays of the spiritual sky there are innumerable planets floating. The brahma-jyotir emanates from the supreme abode, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, and the \u0101nanda-maya, cin-maya planets, which are not material, float in those rays. The Lord says, na tad bh\u0101sayate s\u016bryo na \u015ba\u015b\u0101\u1e45ko na p\u0101vaka\u1e25/ yad gatv\u0101 na nivartante tad dh\u0101ma parama\u1e41 mama. One who can approach that spiritual sky is not required to descend again to the material sky. In the material sky, even if we approach the highest planet (Brahmaloka), what to speak of the moon, we will find the same conditions of life, namely birth, death, disease and old age. No planet in the material universe is free from these four principles of material existence.\n\nThe living entities are traveling from one planet to another, but it is not that we can go to any planet we like merely by a mechanical arrangement. If we desire to go to other planets, there is a process for going there. This is also mentioned: y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n pit\u1e5dn y\u0101nti pit\u1e5b-vrat\u0101\u1e25. No mechanical arrangement is necessary if we want interplanetary travel. The G\u012bt\u0101 instructs: y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n. The moon, the sun and higher planets are called Svargaloka. There are three different statuses of planets: higher, middle and lower planetary systems. The earth belongs to the middle planetary system. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 informs us how to travel to the higher planetary systems (Devaloka) with a very simple formula: y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n. One need only worship the particular demigod of that particular planet and in that way go to the moon, the sun or any of the higher planetary systems.\n\nYet Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 does not advise us to go to any of the planets in this material world, because even if we go to Brahmaloka, the highest planet, through some sort of mechanical contrivance by maybe traveling for forty thousand years (and who would live that long?), we will still find the material inconveniences of birth, death, disease and old age. But one who wants to approach the supreme planet, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, or any other planet within the spiritual sky, will not meet with these material inconveniences. Amongst all of the planets in the spiritual sky there is one supreme planet called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the original planet in the abode of the original Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All of this information is given in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and we are given through its instruction information how to leave the material world and begin a truly blissful life in the spiritual sky.\n\nIn the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the real picture of the material world is given. It is said there:\n\nHere the material world is described as a tree whose roots are upwards and branches are below. We have experience of a tree whose roots are upward: if one stands on the bank of a river or any reservoir of water, he can see that the trees reflected in the water are upside down. The branches go downward and the roots upward. Similarly, this material world is a reflection of the spiritual world. The material world is but a shadow of reality. In the shadow there is no reality or substantiality, but from the shadow we can understand that there are substance and reality. In the desert there is no water, but the mirage suggests that there is such a thing as water. In the material world there is no water, there is no happiness, but the real water of actual happiness is there in the spiritual world.\n\nThe Lord suggests that we attain the spiritual world in the following manner (Bg. 15.5):\n\nThat padam avyayam, or eternal kingdom, can be reached by one who is nirm\u0101na-moha. What does this mean? We are after designations. Someone wants to become \u201csir,\u201d someone wants to become \u201clord,\u201d someone wants to become the president or a rich man or a king or something else. As long as we are attached to these designations, we are attached to the body, because designations belong to the body. But we are not these bodies, and realizing this is the first stage in spiritual realization. We are associated with the three modes of material nature, but we must become detached through devotional service to the Lord. If we are not attached to devotional service to the Lord, then we cannot become detached from the modes of material nature. Designations and attachments are due to our lust and desire, our wanting to lord it over the material nature. As long as we do not give up this propensity of lording it over material nature, there is no possibility of returning to the kingdom of the Supreme, the san\u0101tana-dh\u0101ma. That eternal kingdom, which is never destroyed, can be approached by one who is not bewildered by the attractions of false material enjoyments, who is situated in the service of the Supreme Lord. One so situated can easily approach that supreme abode.\n\nElsewhere in the G\u012bt\u0101 (8.21) it is stated:\n\nAvyakta means unmanifested. Not even all of the material world is manifested before us. Our senses are so imperfect that we cannot even see all of the stars within this material universe. In the Vedic literature we can receive much information about all the planets, and we can believe it or not believe it. All of the important planets are described in the Vedic literatures, especially \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and the spiritual world, which is beyond this material sky, is described as avyakta, unmanifested. One should desire and hanker after that supreme kingdom, for when one attains that kingdom, he does not have to return to this material world.\n\nNext, one may raise the question of how one goes about approaching that abode of the Supreme Lord. Information of this is given in the Eighth Chapter. It is said there:\n\n\u201cAnd whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body remembering Me alone at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.\u201d (Bg. 8.5) One who thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the time of his death goes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One must remember the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; if he quits his body thinking of this form, he surely approaches the spiritual kingdom. Mad-bh\u0101vam refers to the supreme nature of the Supreme Being. The Supreme Being is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha \u2013 that is, His form is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. Our present body is not sac-cid-\u0101nanda. It is asat, not sat. It is not eternal; it is perishable. It is not cit, full of knowledge, but it is full of ignorance. We have no knowledge of the spiritual kingdom, nor do we even have perfect knowledge of this material world, where there are so many things unknown to us. The body is also nir\u0101nanda; instead of being full of bliss it is full of misery. All of the miseries we experience in the material world arise from the body, but one who leaves this body thinking of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at once attains a sac-cid-\u0101nanda body.\n\nThe process of quitting this body and getting another body in the material world is also organized. A man dies after it has been decided what form of body he will have in the next life. Higher authorities, not the living entity himself, make this decision. According to our activities in this life, we either rise or sink. This life is a preparation for the next life. If we can prepare, therefore, in this life to get promotion to the kingdom of God, then surely, after quitting this material body, we will attain a spiritual body just like the Lord\u2019s.\n\nAs explained before, there are different kinds of transcendentalists \u2013 the brahma-v\u0101d\u012b, param\u0101tma-v\u0101d\u012b and the devotee \u2013 and, as mentioned, in the brahma-jyotir (spiritual sky) there are innumerable spiritual planets. The number of these planets is far, far greater than all of the planets of this material world. This material world has been approximated as only one quarter of the creation (ek\u0101\u1e41\u015bena sthito jagat). In this material segment there are millions and billions of universes with trillions of planets and suns, stars and moons. But this whole material creation is only a fragment of the total creation. Most of the creation is in the spiritual sky. One who desires to merge into the existence of the Supreme Brahman is at once transferred to the brahma-jyotir of the Supreme Lord and thus attains the spiritual sky. The devotee, who wants to enjoy the association of the Lord, enters into the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, which are innumerable, and the Supreme Lord by His plenary expansions as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a with four hands and with different names like Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Govinda associates with him there. Therefore at the end of life the transcendentalists think either of the brahma-jyotir, the Param\u0101tm\u0101 or the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In all cases they enter into the spiritual sky, but only the devotee, or he who is in personal touch with the Supreme Lord, enters into the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets or the Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana planet. The Lord further adds that of this \u201cthere is no doubt.\u201d This must be believed firmly. We should not reject that which does not tally with our imagination; our attitude should be that of Arjuna: \u201cI believe everything that You have said.\u201d Therefore when the Lord says that at the time of death whoever thinks of Him as Brahman or Param\u0101tm\u0101 or as the Personality of Godhead certainly enters into the spiritual sky, there is no doubt about it. There is no question of disbelieving it.\n\nThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.6) also explains the general principle that makes it possible to enter the spiritual kingdom simply by thinking of the Supreme at the time of death:\n\n\u201cWhatever state of being one remembers when he quits his present body, in his next life he will attain to that state without fail.\u201d Now, first we must understand that material nature is a display of one of the energies of the Supreme Lord. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a (6.7.61) the total energies of the Supreme Lord are delineated:\n\nThe Supreme Lord has diverse and innumerable energies which are beyond our conception; however, great learned sages or liberated souls have studied these energies and have analyzed them into three parts. All of the energies are of vi\u1e63\u1e47u-\u015bakti, that is to say they are different potencies of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The first energy is par\u0101, transcendental. Living entities also belong to the superior energy, as has already been explained. The other energies, or material energies, are in the mode of ignorance. At the time of death either we can remain in the inferior energy of this material world, or we can transfer to the energy of the spiritual world. So the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.6) says:\n\n\u201cWhatever state of being one remembers when he quits his present body, in his next life he will attain to that state without fail.\u201d\n\nIn life we are accustomed to thinking either of the material or of the spiritual energy. Now, how can we transfer our thoughts from the material energy to the spiritual energy? There are so many literatures which fill our thoughts with the material energy \u2013 newspapers, magazines, novels, etc. Our thinking, which is now absorbed in these literatures, must be transferred to the Vedic literatures. The great sages, therefore, have written so many Vedic literatures, such as the Pur\u0101\u1e47as. The Pur\u0101\u1e47as are not imaginative; they are historical records. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 20.122) there is the following verse:\n\nThe forgetful living entities or conditioned souls have forgotten their relationship with the Supreme Lord, and they are engrossed in thinking of material activities. Just to transfer their thinking power to the spiritual sky, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-dvaip\u0101yana Vy\u0101sa has given a great number of Vedic literatures. First he divided the Vedas into four, then he explained them in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, and for less capable people he wrote the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata there is given the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Then all Vedic literature is summarized in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, and for future guidance he gave a natural commentation on the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, called \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. We must always engage our minds in reading these Vedic literatures. Just as materialists engage their minds in reading newspapers, magazines and so many materialistic literatures, we must transfer our reading to these literatures which are given to us by Vy\u0101sadeva; in that way it will be possible for us to remember the Supreme Lord at the time of death. That is the only way suggested by the Lord, and He guarantees the result: \u201cThere is no doubt.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and at the same time continue your prescribed duty of fighting. With your activities dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you will attain Me without doubt.\u201d (Bg. 8.7)\n\nHe does not advise Arjuna simply to remember Him and give up his occupation. No, the Lord never suggests anything impractical. In this material world, in order to maintain the body one has to work. Human society is divided, according to work, into four divisions of social order \u2013 br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra. The br\u0101hma\u1e47a class or intelligent class is working in one way, the k\u1e63atriya or administrative class is working in another way, and the mercantile class and the laborers are all tending to their specific duties. In the human society, whether one is a laborer, merchant, administrator or farmer, or even if one belongs to the highest class and is a literary man, a scientist or a theologian, he has to work in order to maintain his existence. The Lord therefore tells Arjuna that he need not give up his occupation, but while he is engaged in his occupation he should remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (m\u0101m anusmara). If he doesn\u2019t practice remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a while he is struggling for existence, then it will not be possible for him to remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the time of death. Lord Caitanya also advises this. He says, k\u012brtan\u012bya\u1e25 sad\u0101 hari\u1e25: one should practice chanting the names of the Lord always. The names of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent. So Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instructions to Arjuna to \u201cremember Me\u201d and Lord Caitanya\u2019s injunction to \u201calways chant the names of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u201d are the same instruction. There is no difference, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name are nondifferent. In the absolute status there is no difference between reference and referrent. Therefore we have to practice remembering the Lord always, twenty-four hours a day, by chanting His names and molding our life\u2019s activities in such a way that we can remember Him always.\n\nHow is this possible? The \u0101c\u0101ryas give the following example. If a married woman is attached to another man, or if a man has an attachment for a woman other than his wife, then the attachment is to be considered very strong. One with such an attachment is always thinking of the loved one. The wife who is thinking of her lover is always thinking of meeting him, even while she is carrying out her household chores. In fact, she carries out her household work even more carefully so her husband will not suspect her attachment. Similarly, we should always remember the supreme lover, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and at the same time perform our material duties very nicely. A strong sense of love is required here. If we have a strong sense of love for the Supreme Lord, then we can discharge our duty and at the same time remember Him. But we have to develop that sense of love. Arjuna, for instance, was always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; he was the constant companion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and at the same time he was a warrior. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not advise him to give up fighting and go to the forest to meditate. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a delineates the yoga system to Arjuna, Arjuna says that the practice of this system is not possible for him.\n\n\u201cArjuna said: O Madhus\u016bdana, the system of yoga which You have summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady.\u201d (Bg. 6.33)\n\nBut the Lord says:\n\n\u201cOf all yog\u012bs, the one with great faith who always abides in Me, thinks of Me within himself, and renders transcendental loving service to Me is the most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all. That is My opinion.\u201d (Bg. 6.47) So one who thinks of the Supreme Lord always is the greatest yog\u012b, the supermost j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, and the greatest devotee at the same time. The Lord further tells Arjuna that as a k\u1e63atriya he cannot give up his fighting, but if Arjuna fights remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then he will be able to remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the time of death. But one must be completely surrendered in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.\n\nWe work not with our body, actually, but with our mind and intelligence. So if the intelligence and the mind are always engaged in the thought of the Supreme Lord, then naturally the senses are also engaged in His service. Superficially, at least, the activities of the senses remain the same, but the consciousness is changed. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 teaches one how to absorb the mind and intelligence in the thought of the Lord. Such absorption will enable one to transfer himself to the kingdom of the Lord. If the mind is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service, then the senses are automatically engaged in His service. This is the art, and this is also the secret of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: total absorption in the thought of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nModern man has struggled very hard to reach the moon, but he has not tried very hard to elevate himself spiritually. If one has fifty years of life ahead of him, he should engage that brief time in cultivating this practice of remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This practice is the devotional process:\n\nThese nine processes, of which the easiest is \u015brava\u1e47am, hearing the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from the realized person, will turn one to the thought of the Supreme Being. This will lead to remembering the Supreme Lord and will enable one, upon leaving the body, to attain a spiritual body which is just fit for association with the Supreme Lord.\n\nThe Lord further says:\n\n\u201cHe who meditates on Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly engaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O Arjuna, is sure to reach Me.\u201d (Bg. 8.8)\n\nThis is not a very difficult process. However, one must learn it from an experienced person. Tad-vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa gurum ev\u0101bhigacchet: one must approach a person who is already in the practice. The mind is always flying to this and that, but one must practice concentrating the mind always on the form of the Supreme Lord, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or on the sound of His name. The mind is naturally restless, going hither and thither, but it can rest in the sound vibration of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One must thus meditate on parama\u1e41 puru\u1e63am, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the spiritual kingdom, the spiritual sky, and thus attain Him. The ways and the means for ultimate realization, ultimate attainment, are stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and the doors of this knowledge are open for everyone. No one is barred out. All classes of men can approach Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by thinking of Him, for hearing and thinking of Him are possible for everyone.\n\nThe Lord further says (Bg. 9.32\u201333):\n\nThus the Lord says that even a merchant, a fallen woman or a laborer or even human beings in the lowest status of life can attain the Supreme. One does not need highly developed intelligence. The point is that anyone who accepts the principle of bhakti-yoga and accepts the Supreme Lord as the summum bonum of life, as the highest target, the ultimate goal, can approach the Lord in the spiritual sky. If one adopts the principles enunciated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, he can make his life perfect and make a permanent solution to all the problems of life. This is the sum and substance of the entire Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\nIn conclusion, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is a transcendental literature which one should read very carefully. G\u012bt\u0101-\u015b\u0101stram ida\u1e41 pu\u1e47ya\u1e41 ya\u1e25 pa\u1e6dhet prayata\u1e25 pum\u0101n: if one properly follows the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one can be freed from all the miseries and anxieties of life. Bhaya-\u015bok\u0101di-varjita\u1e25. One will be freed from all fears in this life, and one\u2019s next life will be spiritual (G\u012bt\u0101-m\u0101h\u0101tmya 1).\n\nThere is also a further advantage:\n\n\u201cIf one reads Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 very sincerely and with all seriousness, then by the grace of the Lord the reactions of his past misdeeds will not act upon him.\u201d (G\u012bt\u0101-m\u0101h\u0101tmya 2) The Lord says very loudly in the last portion of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66):\n\n\u201cAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.\u201d Thus the Lord takes all responsibility for one who surrenders unto Him, and He indemnifies such a person against all reactions of sins.\n\n\u201cOne may cleanse himself daily by taking a bath in water, but if one takes a bath even once in the sacred Ganges water of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, for him the dirt of material life is altogether vanquished.\u201d (G\u012bt\u0101-m\u0101h\u0101tmya 3)\n\nBecause Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one need not read any other Vedic literature. One need only attentively and regularly hear and read Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. In the present age, people are so absorbed in mundane activities that it is not possible for them to read all the Vedic literatures. But this is not necessary. This one book, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, will suffice, because it is the essence of all Vedic literatures and especially because it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (G\u012bt\u0101-m\u0101h\u0101tmya 4)\n\nAs it is said:\n\n\u201cOne who drinks the water of the Ganges attains salvation, so what to speak of one who drinks the nectar of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101? Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the essential nectar of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and it is spoken by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, the original Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\u201d (G\u012bt\u0101-m\u0101h\u0101tmya 5) Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 comes from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the Ganges is said to emanate from the lotus feet of the Lord. Of course, there is no difference between the mouth and the feet of the Supreme Lord, but from an impartial study we can appreciate that Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is even more important than the water of the Ganges.\n\n\u201cThis G\u012btopani\u1e63ad, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the essence of all the Upani\u1e63ads, is just like a cow, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is famous as a cowherd boy, is milking this cow. Arjuna is just like a calf, and learned scholars and pure devotees are to drink the nectarean milk of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\u201d (G\u012bt\u0101-m\u0101h\u0101tmya 6)\n\nIn this present day, people are very much eager to have one scripture, one God, one religion and one occupation. Therefore, eka\u1e41 \u015b\u0101stra\u1e41 devak\u012b-putra-g\u012btam: let there be one scripture only, one common scripture for the whole world \u2013 Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Eko devo devak\u012b-putra eva: let there be one God for the whole world \u2013 \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

There it says that one should read Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations. The example of clear understanding is there in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who heard the G\u012bt\u0101 directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to understand the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in that line of disciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world. One will find in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 all that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will also find things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the specific standard of the G\u012bt\u0101. It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nThe topics discussed by Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and Sa\u00f1jaya, as described in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is understood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic age. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet for the guidance of mankind.\n\nThe word dharma-k\u1e63etra (a place where religious rituals are performed) is significant because, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, the father of the Kurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons\u2019 ultimate victory. In his doubt, he inquired from his secretary Sa\u00f1jaya, \u201cWhat did they do?\u201d He was confident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du were assembled in that Field of Kuruk\u1e63etra for a determined engagement of the war. Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kuruk\u1e63etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of worship \u2013 even for the denizens of heaven \u2013 Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra became very fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Sa\u00f1jaya was a student of Vy\u0101sa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra even while he was in the room of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. And so, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra asked him about the situation on the battlefield.\n\nBoth the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra belong to the same family, but Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du from the family heritage.

The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and therefore the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses. The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as senseless, or impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs their senses. But He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity, and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses of Arjuna, and thus His particular name of H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba. The Lord has different names according to His different activities. For example, His name is Madhus\u016bdana because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is V\u0101sudeva because He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devak\u012b-nandana because He accepted Devak\u012b as His mother; His name is Ya\u015bod\u0101-nandana because He awarded His childhood pastimes to Ya\u015bod\u0101 at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana; His name is P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra.\n\nArjuna is referred to as Dhana\u00f1jaya in this verse because he helped his elder brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the king to make expenditures for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bh\u012bma is known as V\u1e5bkodara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform herculean tasks, such as killing the demon Hi\u1e0dimba. So the particular types of conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, beginning with the Lord\u2019s, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers.

As such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen, friends and relatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as his soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he felt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death. And while he was so thinking, the limbs of his body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry. He was more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit. Practically the whole community, all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him. This overwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, still one can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna\u2019s bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up, but he was also crying out of compassion. Such symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord.

What pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra?", "purport": "Arjuna has addressed Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Govinda because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the object of all pleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word, Arjuna indicates that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should understand what will satisfy Arjuna\u2019s senses. But Govinda is not meant for satisfying our senses. If we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda, however, then automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, everyone wants to satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such satisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one takes the opposite way \u2013 namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of Govinda without desiring to satisfy one\u2019s own senses \u2013 then by the grace of Govinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied. Arjuna\u2019s deep affection for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them. He is therefore not prepared to fight. Everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will be killed on the battlefield and he will be unable to share his opulence after victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life, however, is different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a kill them personally. At this point he did not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This fact is disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord\u2019s plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees.

Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is quite befitting any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He was saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a k\u1e63atriya. Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be cowardly. For example, Lord R\u0101ma was so saintly that people even now are anxious to live in the kingdom of Lord R\u0101ma (r\u0101ma-r\u0101jya), but Lord R\u0101ma never showed any cowardice. R\u0101va\u1e47a was an aggressor against R\u0101ma because R\u0101va\u1e47a kidnapped R\u0101ma\u2019s wife, S\u012bt\u0101, but Lord R\u0101ma gave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In Arjuna\u2019s case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna\u2019s addressing of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as \u201cM\u0101dhava,\u201d or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this connection. He wanted to point out to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that, as the husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees."}, {"verse": "TEXTS 37-38", "devanagari": "\u092f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u092a\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0924\u0947 \u0928 \u092a\u0936\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0932\u094b\u092d\u094b\u092a\u0939\u0924\u091a\u0947\u0924\u0938\u0903 \u0964\n\u0915\u0941\u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u092f\u0915\u0943\u0924\u0902 \u0926\u094b\u0937\u0902 \u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0926\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0939\u0947 \u091a \u092a\u093e\u0924\u0915\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0969\u096d \u0965\n\u0915\u0925\u0902 \u0928 \u091c\u094d\u091e\u0947\u092f\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u092d\u093f\u0903 \u092a\u093e\u092a\u093e\u0926\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u0915\u0941\u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u092f\u0915\u0943\u0924\u0902 \u0926\u094b\u0937\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092a\u0936\u094d\u092f\u0926\u094d\u092d\u200d\u093f\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0928\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0928 \u0965 \u0969\u096e \u0965", "verse-text": "yady apy ete na pa\u015byanti\nlobhopahata-cetasa\u1e25\nkula-k\u1e63aya-k\u1e5bta\u1e41 do\u1e63a\u1e41\nmitra-drohe ca p\u0101takam\n\nkatha\u1e41 na j\u00f1eyam asm\u0101bhi\u1e25\np\u0101p\u0101d asm\u0101n nivartitum\nkula-k\u1e63aya-k\u1e5bta\u1e41 do\u1e63a\u1e41\nprapa\u015byadbhir jan\u0101rdana", "synonyms": "yadi \u2014 if; api \u2014 even; ete \u2014 they; na \u2014 do not; pa\u015byanti \u2014 see; lobha \u2014 by greed; upahata \u2014 overpowered; cetasa\u1e25 \u2014 their hearts; kula-k\u1e63aya \u2014 in killing the family; k\u1e5btam \u2014 done; do\u1e63am \u2014 fault; mitra-drohe \u2014 in quarreling with friends; ca \u2014 also; p\u0101takam \u2014 sinful reactions; katham \u2014 why; na \u2014 should not; j\u00f1eyam \u2014 be known; asm\u0101bhi\u1e25 \u2014 by us; p\u0101p\u0101t \u2014 from sins; asm\u0101t \u2014 these; nivartitum \u2014 to cease; kula-k\u1e63aya \u2014 in the destruction of a dynasty; k\u1e5btam \u2014 done; do\u1e63am \u2014 crime; prapa\u015byadbhi\u1e25 \u2014 by those who can see; jan\u0101rdana \u2014 O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.", "translation": "O Jan\u0101rdana, although these men, their hearts overtaken by greed, see no fault in killing one\u2019s family or quarreling with friends, why should we, who can see the crime in destroying a family, engage in these acts of sin?", "purport": "A k\u1e63atriya is not supposed to refuse to battle or gamble when he is so invited by some rival party.

The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman, or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Param\u0101tm\u0101, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and Bhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d\n\nThese three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun\u2019s surface and the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student. One who understands the sun\u2019s surface is further advanced. And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine \u2013 its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature \u2013 may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the bhaktas, or the transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagav\u0101n feature of the Absolute Truth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter. The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category.\n\nThe Sanskrit word bhagav\u0101n is explained by the great authority Par\u0101\u015bara Muni, the father of Vy\u0101sadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called Bhagav\u0101n. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity, including Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, can possess opulences as fully as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 by Lord Brahm\u0101 himself that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagav\u0101n, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes:\n\n\u201cThere are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagav\u0101n, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes.\u201d (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.1)\n\nIn the Bh\u0101gavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described as the original Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand:\n\n\u201cAll the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.3.28)\n\nTherefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman.\n\nIn the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna\u2019s lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a expressed His surprise with the word kuta\u1e25, \u201cwherefrom.\u201d Such impurities were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as \u0100ryans. The word \u0101ryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the Absolute Truth, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Bhagav\u0101n, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-\u0100ryans. Although Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya, he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described as befitting the non-\u0100ryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen."}, {"verse": "TEXT 3", "devanagari": "\u0915\u094d\u0932\u200d\u0948\u092c\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u092e\u093e \u0938\u094d\u092e \u0917\u092e\u0903 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u0928\u0948\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092f\u094d\u092f\u0941\u092a\u092a\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0964\n\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u0939\u0943\u0926\u092f\u0926\u094c\u0930\u094d\u092c\u0932\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920 \u092a\u0930\u0928\u094d\u0924\u092a \u0965 \u0969 \u0965", "verse-text": "klaibya\u1e41 m\u0101 sma gama\u1e25 p\u0101rtha\nnaitat tvayy upapadyate\nk\u1e63udra\u1e41 h\u1e5bdaya-daurbalya\u1e41\ntyaktvotti\u1e63\u1e6dha paran-tapa", "synonyms": "klaibyam \u2014 impotence; m\u0101 sma \u2014 do not; gama\u1e25 \u2014 take to; p\u0101rtha \u2014 O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; na \u2014 never; etat \u2014 this; tvayi \u2014 unto you; upapadyate \u2014 is befitting; k\u1e63udram \u2014 petty; h\u1e5bdaya \u2014 of the heart; daurbalyam \u2014 weakness; tyaktv\u0101 \u2014 giving up; utti\u1e63\u1e6dha \u2014 get up; param-tapa \u2014 O chastiser of the enemies.", "translation": "O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, do not yield to this degrading impotence.

In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life, which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this verse.\n\nWho is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the problems of life. In the B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (3.8.10) the perplexed man is described as follows: yo v\u0101 etad ak\u1e63ara\u1e41 g\u0101rgy aviditv\u0101sm\u0101\u1e3b lok\u0101t praiti sa k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a\u1e25. \u201cHe is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science of self-realization.\u201d This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the living entity, who can utilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other hand, there is the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life. Ya etad ak\u1e63ara\u1e41 g\u0101rgi viditv\u0101sm\u0101l lok\u0101t praiti sa br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u1e25.\n\nThe k\u1e5bpa\u1e47as, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on the basis of \u201cskin disease.\u201d The k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death; or the k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals, who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes of his perplexities. Although he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and Arjuna is the first disciple for understanding the G\u012bt\u0101. How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is stated in the G\u012bt\u0101 itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a person, but to \u201cthe unborn within K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d There is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s within and without.

He could understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in solving the problems of life; help can be given only by a spiritual master like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred percent K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is the bona fide spiritual master, for he can solve the problems of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is a master in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual master.\n\n\u201cIt does not matter whether a person is a vipra [learned scholar in Vedic wisdom], or is born in a lower family, or is in the renounced order of life \u2013 if he is a master in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is the perfect and bona fide spiritual master.\u201d (Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, Madhya 8.128) So without being a master in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, no one is a bona fide spiritual master. It is also said in the Vedic literature:\n\n\u201cA scholarly br\u0101hma\u1e47a, expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to become a spiritual master without being a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or expert in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a spiritual master if he is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.\u201d (Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a)\n\nThe problems of material existence \u2013 birth, old age, disease and death \u2013 cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development. In many parts of the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life, which are full of wealth and economically developed, yet the problems of material existence are still present. They are seeking peace in different ways, but they can achieve real happiness only if they consult K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam \u2013 which constitute the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 through the bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nIf economic development and material comforts could drive away one\u2019s lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then Arjuna would not have said that even an unrivaled kingdom on earth or supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would be unable to drive away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic development or supremacy over the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material nature. Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking on the moon planet, can also be finished at one stroke. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms this: k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martya-loka\u1e41 vi\u015banti. \u201cWhen the results of pious activities are finished, one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of life.\u201d Many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation.\n\nTherefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to solve his problem definitely, and that is the way of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}, {"verse": "TEXT 9", "devanagari": "\u0938\u091e\u094d\u091c\u092f \u0909\u0935\u093e\u091a\n\u090f\u0935\u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e \u0939\u0943\u0937\u0940\u0915\u0947\u0936\u0902 \u0917\u0941\u0921\u093e\u0915\u0947\u0936\u0903 \u092a\u0930\u0928\u094d\u0924\u092a\u0903 \u0964\n\u0928 \u092f\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0907\u0924\u093f \u0917\u094b\u0935\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093e\u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e \u0924\u0942\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0940\u0902 \u092c\u092d\u0942\u0935 \u0939 \u0965 \u096f \u0965", "verse-text": "sa\u00f1jaya uv\u0101ca\nevam uktv\u0101 h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba\u1e41\ngu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba\u1e25 paran-tapa\u1e25\nna yotsya iti govindam\nuktv\u0101 t\u016b\u1e63\u1e47\u012b\u1e41 babh\u016bva ha", "synonyms": "sa\u00f1jaya\u1e25 uv\u0101ca \u2014 Sa\u00f1jaya said; evam \u2014 thus; uktv\u0101 \u2014 speaking; h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015bam \u2014 unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the master of the senses; gu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba\u1e25 \u2014 Arjuna, the master of curbing ignorance; param-tapa\u1e25 \u2014 the chastiser of the enemies; na yotsye \u2014 I shall not fight; iti \u2014 thus; govindam \u2014 unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the giver of pleasure to the senses; uktv\u0101 \u2014 saying; t\u016b\u1e63\u1e47\u012bm \u2014 silent; babh\u016bva \u2014 became; ha \u2014 certainly.", "translation": "Sa\u00f1jaya said: Having spoken thus, Arjuna, chastiser of enemies, told K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cGovinda, I shall not fight,\u201d and fell silent.", "purport": "Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra must have been very glad to understand that Arjuna was not going to fight and was instead leaving the battlefield for the begging profession.

That Supreme Personality of Godhead is also, by His plenary portions, alive in the heart of every living entity. Only saintly persons who can see, within and without, the same Supreme Lord can actually attain to perfect and eternal peace.\n\nThe same Vedic truth given to Arjuna is given to all persons in the world who pose themselves as very learned but factually have but a poor fund of knowledge. The Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna and all the kings who are assembled on the battlefield are eternally individual beings and that the Lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in their conditioned and in their liberated situations. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord\u2019s eternal associate, and all the kings assembled there are individual eternal persons. It is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will not remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past, and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption. Therefore, there is no cause for lamentation for anyone.\n\nThe M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the covering of m\u0101y\u0101, or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the Upani\u1e63ads, will continue eternally. This statement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s is authoritative because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality were not a fact, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would not have stressed it so much \u2013 even for the future. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b may argue that the individuality spoken of by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not spiritual, but material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s individuality? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a affirms His individuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He has confirmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be subordinate to Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then His Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 has no value as authoritative scripture. A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing. The G\u012bt\u0101 is above such literature. No mundane book compares with the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. When one accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary man, the G\u012bt\u0101 loses all importance. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great \u0101c\u0101ryas like \u015ar\u012b R\u0101m\u0101nuja and others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in the G\u012bt\u0101 that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the great literature. The nondevotee\u2019s approach to the teachings of the G\u012bt\u0101 is something like that of a bee licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the G\u012bt\u0101 be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b explanation of the G\u012bt\u0101 is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the G\u012bt\u0101. If individuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is confirmed by the Vedas as above mentioned."}, {"verse": "TEXT 13", "devanagari": "\u0926\u0947\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094b\u093d\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0925\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0939\u0947 \u0915\u094c\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0902 \u092f\u094c\u0935\u0928\u0902 \u091c\u0930\u093e \u0964\n\u0924\u0925\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0939\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092a\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0927\u0940\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0928 \u092e\u0941\u0939\u094d\u092f\u0924\u093f \u0965 \u0967\u0969 \u0965", "verse-text": "dehino \u2019smin yath\u0101 dehe\nkaum\u0101ra\u1e41 yauvana\u1e41 jar\u0101\ntath\u0101 deh\u0101ntara-pr\u0101ptir\ndh\u012bras tatra na muhyati", "synonyms": "dehina\u1e25 \u2014 of the embodied; asmin \u2014 in this; yath\u0101 \u2014 as; dehe \u2014 in the body; kaum\u0101ram \u2014 boyhood; yauvanam \u2014 youth; jar\u0101 \u2014 old age; tath\u0101 \u2014 similarly; deha-antara \u2014 of transference of the body; pr\u0101pti\u1e25 \u2014 achievement; dh\u012bra\u1e25 \u2014 the sober; tatra \u2014 thereupon; na \u2014 never; muhyati \u2014 is deluded.", "translation": "As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death.

Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change. This individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth \u2013 either material or spiritual \u2013 there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bh\u012b\u1e63ma nor for Dro\u1e47a, for whom he was so much concerned. Rather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to one\u2019s work in life. So Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a, being noble souls, were surely going to have spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.\n\nAny man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul, the Supersoul, and nature \u2013 both material and spiritual \u2013 is called a dh\u012bra, or a most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies.\n\nThe M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained, on the ground that the spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion. Such cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul\u2019s being unchangeable. As confirmed in the G\u012bt\u0101, the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally (san\u0101tana) and are called k\u1e63ara; that is, they have a tendency to fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after liberation the individual soul remains the same \u2013 fragmental. But once liberated, he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the Personality of Godhead. The theory of reflection can be applied to the Supersoul, who is present in each and every individual body and is known as the Param\u0101tm\u0101. He is different from the individual living entity. When the sky is reflected in water, the reflections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also. The stars can be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the Supreme Lord. The individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They are not on the same level, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If Arjuna is on the same level with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not superior to Arjuna, then their relationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless. If both of them are deluded by the illusory energy (m\u0101y\u0101), then there is no need of one being the instructor and the other the instructed. Such instruction would be useless because, in the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, no one can be an authoritative instructor. Under the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord, superior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgetful soul deluded by m\u0101y\u0101."}, {"verse": "TEXT 14", "devanagari": "\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0930\u094d\u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u0915\u094c\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947\u092f \u0936\u0940\u0924\u094b\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0938\u0941\u0916\u0926\u0941\u0903\u0916\u0926\u093e\u0903 \u0964\n\u0906\u0917\u092e\u093e\u092a\u093e\u092f\u093f\u0928\u094b\u093d\u0928\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0938\u094d\u0935 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0965 \u0967\u096a \u0965", "verse-text": "m\u0101tr\u0101-spar\u015b\u0101s tu kaunteya\n\u015b\u012bto\u1e63\u1e47a-sukha-du\u1e25kha-d\u0101\u1e25\n\u0101gam\u0101p\u0101yino \u2019nity\u0101s\nt\u0101\u1e41s titik\u1e63asva bh\u0101rata", "synonyms": "m\u0101tr\u0101-spar\u015b\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 sensory perception; tu \u2014 only; kaunteya \u2014 O son of Kunt\u012b; \u015b\u012bta \u2014 winter; u\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 summer; sukha \u2014 happiness; du\u1e25kha \u2014 and pain; d\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 giving; \u0101gama \u2014 appearing; ap\u0101yina\u1e25 \u2014 disappearing; anity\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 nonpermanent; t\u0101n \u2014 all of them; titik\u1e63asva \u2014 just try to tolerate; bh\u0101rata \u2014 O descendant of the Bharata dynasty.", "translation": "O son of Kunt\u012b, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons.

Yet for a higher cause He took sanny\u0101sa and was steady in the discharge of higher duties.

That the body is changing every moment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by modern medical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the body. But the spirit soul exists permanently, remaining the same despite all changes of the body and the mind. That is the difference between matter and spirit. By nature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal. This conclusion is established by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist and personalist. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a (2.12.38) it is stated that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and His abodes all have self-illuminated spiritual existence (jyot\u012b\u1e41\u1e63i vi\u1e63\u1e47ur bhuvan\u0101ni vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25).

In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, as well as in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the Supreme has been accepted as the origin of all emanations. Such emanations are experienced by superior and inferior natural sequences. The living entities belong to the superior nature, as it will be revealed in the Seventh Chapter. Although there is no difference between the energy and the energetic, the energetic is accepted as the Supreme, and the energy or nature is accepted as the subordinate. The living entities, therefore, are always subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case of the master and the servant, or the teacher and the taught. Such clear knowledge is impossible to understand under the spell of ignorance, and to drive away such ignorance the Lord teaches the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 for the enlightenment of all living entities for all time."}, {"verse": "TEXT 17", "devanagari": "\u0905\u0935\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0936\u093f \u0924\u0941 \u0924\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f \u092f\u0947\u0928 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u092e\u093f\u0926\u0902 \u0924\u0924\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u0935\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0936\u092e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0928 \u0915\u0936\u094d\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0941\u092e\u0930\u094d\u0939\u0924\u093f \u0965 \u0967\u096d \u0965", "verse-text": "avin\u0101\u015bi tu tad viddhi\nyena sarvam ida\u1e41 tatam\nvin\u0101\u015bam avyayasy\u0101sya\nna ka\u015bcit kartum arhati", "synonyms": "avin\u0101\u015bi \u2014 imperishable; tu \u2014 but; tat \u2014 that; viddhi \u2014 know it; yena \u2014 by whom; sarvam \u2014 all of the body; idam \u2014 this; tatam \u2014 pervaded; vin\u0101\u015bam \u2014 destruction; avyayasya \u2014 of the imperishable; asya \u2014 of it; na ka\u015bcit \u2014 no one; kartum \u2014 to do; arhati \u2014 is able.", "translation": "That which pervades the entire body you should know to be indestructible.

Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is consciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one\u2019s own body. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore, each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul\u2019s presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This soul is described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in size. The \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (5.9) confirms this:\n\n\u201cWhen the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul.\u201d Similarly the same version is stated:\n\n\u201cThere are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.\u201d\n\nTherefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul. In the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad (3.1.9) the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained:\n\n\u201cThe soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air (pr\u0101\u1e47a, ap\u0101na, vy\u0101na, sam\u0101na and ud\u0101na), is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is exhibited.\u201d\n\nThe ha\u1e6dha-yoga system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air encircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures \u2013 not for any material profit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the material atmosphere.\n\nSo the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only the insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva.\n\nThe influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body. According to the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad, this atomic soul is situated in the heart of every living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them assert foolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is definitely there in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily movement are emanating from this part of the body. The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul passes away from this position, the activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases. Medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul. Medical science, however, does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.\n\nSuch atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine molecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly, the fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the Supreme Lord, called by the name prabh\u0101, or superior energy. So whether one follows Vedic knowledge or modern science, one cannot deny the existence of the spirit soul in the body, and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the Personality of Godhead Himself."}, {"verse": "TEXT 18", "devanagari": "\u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924 \u0907\u092e\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0939\u093e \u0928\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0903 \u0936\u0930\u0940\u0930\u093f\u0923\u0903 \u0964\n\u0905\u0928\u093e\u0936\u093f\u0928\u094b\u093d\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0947\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0924\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u0935 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0965 \u0967\u096e \u0965", "verse-text": "antavanta ime deh\u0101\nnityasyokt\u0101\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bri\u1e47a\u1e25\nan\u0101\u015bino \u2019prameyasya\ntasm\u0101d yudhyasva bh\u0101rata", "synonyms": "anta-vanta\u1e25 \u2014 perishable; ime \u2014 all these; deh\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 material bodies; nityasya \u2014 eternal in existence; ukt\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 are said; \u015bar\u012bri\u1e47a\u1e25 \u2014 of the embodied soul; an\u0101\u015bina\u1e25 \u2014 never to be destroyed; aprameyasya \u2014 immeasurable; tasm\u0101t \u2014 therefore; yudhyasva \u2014 fight; bh\u0101rata \u2014 O descendant of Bharata.", "translation": "The material body of the indestructible, immeasurable and eternal living entity is sure to come to an end; therefore, fight, O descendant of Bharata.", "purport": "The material body is perishable by nature.

Sometimes the soul is called the steady, or k\u016b\u1e6da-stha. The body is subject to six kinds of transformations. It takes its birth from the womb of the mother\u2019s body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing and primeval \u2013 that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul\u2019s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body.\n\nIn the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad (1.2.18) we also find a similar passage, which reads:\n\nThe meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, but here in this verse there is one special word, vipa\u015bcit, which means learned or with knowledge.\n\nThe soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore, consciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find the soul within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the sun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all bodies \u2013 whether man or animal \u2013 we can understand the presence of the soul. This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge \u2013 past, present and future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When he is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Even the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept continuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the change is transferred to another body. This has already been explained in a previous verse (2.13).\n\nTransference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the Supersoul. The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas, like the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad, as well as the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad, compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds \u2013 although they are the same in quality \u2013 one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one\u2019s changing his position from one tree to another, or from one body to another. The j\u012bva soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual master \u2013 as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for instruction \u2013 the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad (3.1.2) and \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (4.7) confirm this:\n\n\u201cAlthough the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend the Lord and knows His glories \u2013 at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties.\u201d Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and is understanding the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from Him. And thus, hearing from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.\n\nArjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their bodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down his life on the sacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life.

Even the nuclear weapons of the modern age are classified as fire weapons, but formerly there were other weapons made of all different types of material elements.

When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, it appears that such philosophers existed, and they were known as the Lok\u0101yatikas and Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas. Such philosophers maintain that life symptoms take place at a certain mature condition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo religions \u2013 now becoming fashionable in America \u2013 are also adhering to this philosophy, as are the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.\n\nEven if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul \u2013 as in the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika philosophy \u2013 there would still have been no cause for lamentation. No one laments the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed duty. On the other hand, in modern science and scientific warfare, so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy. According to the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika philosophy, the so-called soul or \u0101tm\u0101 vanishes along with the deterioration of the body. So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul or he did not believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According to this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment, and so many of them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to grieve for such incidents. If there were no rebirth for the soul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected by sinful reactions due to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sarcastically addressed Arjuna as mah\u0101-b\u0101hu, mighty-armed, because He, at least, did not accept the theory of the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas, which leaves aside the Vedic wisdom.

Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for argument\u2019s sake, we accept this atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of nonmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested \u2013 that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or in unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost.

The material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is something like a dream. In a dream we may think of flying in the sky, or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body.

Men with a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not austere cannot understand the wonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it is explained by the greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even to Brahm\u0101, the first living being in the universe.

In the religious law books it is stated:\n\n\u201cIn the battlefield, a king or k\u1e63atriya, while fighting another king envious of him, is eligible for achieving the heavenly planets after death, as the br\u0101hma\u1e47as also attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial fire.\u201d Therefore, killing on the battlefield on religious principles and killing animals in the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be acts of violence, because everyone is benefited by the religious principles involved. The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing the gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, and the k\u1e63atriyas killed on the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets, as do the br\u0101hma\u1e47as who attain them by offering sacrifice.\n\nThere are two kinds of sva-dharmas, specific duties. As long as one is not liberated, one has to perform the duties of his particular body in accordance with religious principles in order to achieve liberation. When one is liberated, one\u2019s sva-dharma \u2013 specific duty \u2013 becomes spiritual and is not in the material bodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas respectively, and such duties are unavoidable. Sva-dharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth Chapter. On the bodily plane sva-dharma is called var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, or man\u2019s steppingstone for spiritual understanding. Human civilization begins from the stage of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, or specific duties in terms of the specific modes of nature of the body obtained. Discharging one\u2019s specific duty in any field of action in accordance with the orders of higher authorities serves to elevate one to a higher status of life."}, {"verse": "TEXT 32", "devanagari": "\u092f\u0926\u0943\u091a\u094d\u091b\u092f\u093e \u091a\u094b\u092a\u092a\u0928\u094d\u0928\u0902 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u092e\u092a\u093e\u0935\u0943\u0924\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u0938\u0941\u0916\u093f\u0928\u0903 \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u0932\u092d\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u092f\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u092e\u0940\u0926\u0943\u0936\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0969\u0968 \u0965", "verse-text": "yad\u1e5bcchay\u0101 copapanna\u1e41\nsvarga-dv\u0101ram ap\u0101v\u1e5btam\nsukhina\u1e25 k\u1e63atriy\u0101\u1e25 p\u0101rtha\nlabhante yuddham \u012bd\u1e5b\u015bam", "synonyms": "yad\u1e5bcchay\u0101 \u2014 by its own accord; ca \u2014 also; upapannam \u2014 arrived at; svarga \u2014 of the heavenly planets; dv\u0101ram \u2014 door; ap\u0101v\u1e5btam \u2014 wide open; sukhina\u1e25 \u2014 very happy; k\u1e63atriy\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 the members of the royal order; p\u0101rtha \u2014 O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; labhante \u2014 do achieve; yuddham \u2014 war; \u012bd\u1e5b\u015bam \u2014 like this.", "translation": "O P\u0101rtha, happy are the k\u1e63atriyas to whom such fighting opportunities come unsought, opening for them the doors of the heavenly planets.", "purport": "As supreme teacher of the world, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a condemns the attitude of Arjuna, who said, \u201cI do not find any good in this fighting.

And yoga involves controlling the senses. Arjuna\u2019s proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting, because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom after conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense gratification, even at a sacrifice of wisdom and duty. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally. We simply change our bodily dress in different manners, but actually we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as S\u0101\u1e45khya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This S\u0101\u1e45khya has nothing to do with the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila\u2019s S\u0101\u1e45khya, the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy was expounded in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who explained it to His mother, Devah\u016bti. It is clearly explained by Him that the puru\u1e63a, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the prak\u1e5bti. This is accepted in the Vedas and in the G\u012bt\u0101. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prak\u1e5bti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individual souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of m\u0101y\u0101, or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto V\u0101sudeva, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth.\n\nArjuna has already accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: \u015bi\u1e63yas te \u2019ha\u1e41 \u015b\u0101dhi m\u0101\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 prapannam. Consequently, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the Lord. This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Param\u0101tm\u0101 in everyone\u2019s heart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga by the special grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love. In that way the devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.\n\nThus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word S\u0101\u1e45khya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga enunciated by the imposter Kapila. One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic S\u0101\u1e45khya. Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time; nor would Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a care to mention such godless philosophical speculations. Real S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, but even that S\u0101\u1e45khya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, S\u0101\u1e45khya means analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s S\u0101\u1e45khya and Lord Kapila\u2019s S\u0101\u1e45khya, as described in the Bh\u0101gavatam, are one and the same. They are all bhakti-yoga. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga and bhakti-yoga (s\u0101\u1e45khya-yogau p\u1e5bthag b\u0101l\u0101\u1e25 pravadanti na pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25).\n\nOf course, atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga is referred to in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\nOne should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be, is working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in transcendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental understanding automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness. Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform."}, {"verse": "TEXT 40", "devanagari": "\u0928\u0947\u0939\u093e\u092d\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0928\u093e\u0936\u094b\u093d\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0935\u093e\u092f\u094b \u0928 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0964\n\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0932\u094d\u092a\u092e\u092a\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u092e\u0939\u0924\u094b \u092d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d \u0965 \u096a\u0966 \u0965", "verse-text": "neh\u0101bhikrama-n\u0101\u015bo \u2019sti\npratyav\u0101yo na vidyate\nsv-alpam apy asya dharmasya\ntr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t", "synonyms": "na \u2014 there is not; iha \u2014 in this yoga; abhikrama \u2014 in endeavoring; n\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 \u2014 loss; asti \u2014 there is; pratyav\u0101ya\u1e25 \u2014 diminution; na \u2014 never; vidyate \u2014 there is; su-alpam \u2014 a little; api \u2014 although; asya \u2014 of this; dharmasya \u2014 occupation; tr\u0101yate \u2014 releases; mahata\u1e25 \u2014 from very great; bhay\u0101t \u2014 danger.", "translation": "In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.", "purport": "Activity in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or acting for the benefit of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without expectation of sense gratification, is the highest transcendental quality of work. Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage. Any work begun on the material plane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But any work begun in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not finished. The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is incomplete. One percent done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent, whereas in material activity without a hundred percent success there is no profit. Aj\u0101mila performed his duty in some percentage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the Lord.

The Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 22.62) states:\n\nFaith means unflinching trust in something sublime. When one is engaged in the duties of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material world with obligations to family traditions, humanity or nationality. Fruitive activities are the engagements of one\u2019s reactions from past good or bad deeds. When one is awake in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities. When one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically achieved by progressive K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nThe resolute purpose of a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is based on knowledge. V\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 su-durlabha\u1e25: a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the rare good soul who knows perfectly that V\u0101sudeva, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the root of all manifested causes. As by watering the root of a tree one automatically distributes water to the leaves and branches, so by acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one can render the highest service to everyone \u2013 namely self, family, society, country, humanity, etc. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is satisfied by one\u2019s actions, then everyone will be satisfied.\n\nService in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As such, to be well versed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one has to act firmly and obey the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and one should accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one\u2019s mission in life. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura instructs us, in his famous prayers for the spiritual master, as follows:\n\n\u201cBy satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satisfied.

And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): the purpose of studying the Vedas is to know Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization means understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and one\u2019s eternal relationship with Him. The relationship of the living entities with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7). The living entities are parts and parcels of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore, revival of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge. This is confirmed in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.33.7) as follows:\n\n\u201cO my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la [dog-eater], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a person is considered to be the best of the \u0100ryan family.\u201d\n\nSo one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the Vedas, without being attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification. It is not possible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals, nor is it possible to study all of the Ved\u0101nta and the Upani\u1e63ads thoroughly. It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas. This is hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prak\u0101\u015b\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying Ved\u0101nta philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master had found Him to be a great fool and thus asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He did so, and became ecstatic like a madman. In this Age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand Ved\u0101nta philosophy; the best purpose of Ved\u0101nta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the Lord. Ved\u0101nta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the Ved\u0101nta philosophy is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and the highest Ved\u0101ntist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord.

Prescribed duties are activities enjoined in terms of one\u2019s acquired modes of material nature. Capricious work means actions without the sanction of authority, and inaction means not performing one\u2019s prescribed duties. The Lord advised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform his prescribed duty without being attached to the result. One who is attached to the result of his work is also the cause of the action. Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of the result of such actions.\n\nAs far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be fitted into three subdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities. Routine work performed as an obligation in terms of the scriptural injunctions, without desire for results, is action in the mode of goodness. Work with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not auspicious. Everyone has his proprietary right in regard to prescribed duties, but should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory duties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.\n\nArjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty without attachment to the result.

Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord\u2019s grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and is not influenced by attachment or aversion.

To understand one\u2019s actual position as the eternal servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of everything, everything must be used for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious he fought because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the same Arjuna fought to his best ability. Real desirelessness is desire for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the quality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (\u012b\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam), and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge is based on self-realization \u2013 namely, knowing perfectly well that every living entity is an eternal part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in spiritual identity, and that the eternal position of the living entity is therefore never on the level of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or greater than Him.

Kha\u1e6dv\u0101\u1e45ga Mah\u0101r\u0101ja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a means ending the process of materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 teaches differently. Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he at once attains the stage of brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a. There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Attainment of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.\n\nBrahman is just the opposite of matter.

In this verse, the Lord explains the same more clearly. S\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga, or the analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and philosophy. The other class of men work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as it is explained in the sixty-first verse of the Second Chapter. The Lord has explained, also in the thirty-ninth verse, that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, furthermore, there is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly explained in the sixty-first verse \u2013 that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or more specifically, on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), and in this way all the senses can be brought under control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas are interdependent, as religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The ultimate goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The whole process is to understand the real position of the self in relation to the Superself.

The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25. The Lord says that the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it is said: pati\u1e41 vi\u015bvasy\u0101tme\u015bvaram.

The Lord created this material world to enable the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yaj\u00f1as (sacrifices) for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, so that while in the material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety, and after finishing the present material body they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program for the conditioned soul. By performance of yaj\u00f1a, the conditioned souls gradually become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and become godly in all respects. In the Age of Kali, the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age.

Therefore, they must be satisfied by the performance of prescribed yaj\u00f1as. In the Vedas, there are different kinds of yaj\u00f1as prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended. According to the different material qualities of the persons concerned, different types of yaj\u00f1as are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different demigods is also on the same basis \u2013 namely, according to different qualities. For example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, the ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals is recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the transcendental worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is recommended. But ultimately all yaj\u00f1as are meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at least five yaj\u00f1as, known as pa\u00f1ca-mah\u0101-yaj\u00f1a, are necessary.\n\nOne should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can manufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human society. These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like meats, none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for example heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life \u2013 none of them can be manufactured by the human society. Without the Supreme Lord, there can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without which no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependent on supplies from the Lord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials \u2013 all of which are supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance of yaj\u00f1as. If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature. A society of thieves can never be happy, because they have no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform yaj\u00f1as. Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yaj\u00f1a, namely the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, which can be performed by anyone in the world who accepts the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}, {"verse": "TEXT 13", "devanagari": "\u092f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0936\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0936\u093f\u0928\u0903 \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094b \u092e\u0941\u091a\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0915\u093f\u0932\u094d\u092c\u093f\u0937\u0948 \u0964\n\u092d\u0941\u091e\u094d\u091c\u0924\u0947 \u0924\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u0935\u0918\u0902 \u092a\u093e\u092a\u093e \u092f\u0947 \u092a\u091a\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0923\u093e\u0924\u094d \u0965 \u0967\u0969 \u0965", "verse-text": "yaj\u00f1a-\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u015bina\u1e25 santo\nmucyante sarva-kilbi\u1e63ai\u1e25\nbhu\u00f1jate te tv agha\u1e41 p\u0101p\u0101\nye pacanty \u0101tma-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101t", "synonyms": "yaj\u00f1a-\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6da \u2014 of food taken after performance of yaj\u00f1a; a\u015bina\u1e25 \u2014 eaters; santa\u1e25 \u2014 the devotees; mucyante \u2014 get relief; sarva \u2014 all kinds of; kilbi\u1e63ai\u1e25 \u2014 from sins; bhu\u00f1jate \u2014 enjoy; te \u2014 they; tu \u2014 but; agham \u2014 grievous sins; p\u0101p\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 sinners; ye \u2014 who; pacanti \u2014 prepare food; \u0101tma-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101t \u2014 for sense enjoyment.", "translation": "The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice.

When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, offer food to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and then eat \u2013 a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, who eats only food offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by accepting pras\u0101dam of the Lord (food offered to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination.\n\nFood grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend on the production of the field and not on the production of big factories. The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot perform them will find himself in scarcity \u2013 that is the law of nature. Yaj\u00f1a, specifically the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a prescribed for this age, must therefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply."}, {"verse": "TEXT 15", "devanagari": "\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u094b\u0926\u094d\u092d\u200d\u0935\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u092d\u200d\u0935\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0917\u0924\u0902 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e \u0928\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u092f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093f\u0924\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0967\u096b \u0965", "verse-text": "karma brahmodbhava\u1e41 viddhi\nbrahm\u0101k\u1e63ara-samudbhavam\ntasm\u0101t sarva-gata\u1e41 brahma\nnitya\u1e41 yaj\u00f1e prati\u1e63\u1e6dhitam", "synonyms": "karma \u2014 work; brahma \u2014 from the Vedas; udbhavam \u2014 produced; viddhi \u2014 you should know; brahma \u2014 the Vedas; ak\u1e63ara \u2014 from the Supreme Brahman (Personality of Godhead); samudbhavam \u2014 directly manifested; tasm\u0101t \u2014 therefore; sarva-gatam \u2014 all-pervading; brahma \u2014 transcendence; nityam \u2014 eternally; yaj\u00f1e \u2014 in sacrifice; prati\u1e63\u1e6dhitam \u2014 situated.", "translation": "Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly manifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

If we have to work for the satisfaction of the yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, then we must find out the direction of work in Brahman, or the transcendental Vedas. The Vedas are therefore codes of working directions. Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is called vikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always take direction from the Vedas to be saved from the reaction of work. As one has to work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, one similarly has to work under direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such directions in the Vedas are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said, asya mahato bh\u016btasya ni\u015bvasitam etad yad \u1e5bg-vedo yajur-veda\u1e25 s\u0101ma-vedo \u2019tharv\u0101\u1e45girasa\u1e25. \u201cThe four Vedas \u2013 namely the \u1e5ag Veda, Yajur Veda, S\u0101ma Veda and Atharva Veda \u2013 are all emanations from the breathing of the great Personality of Godhead.\u201d (B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad 4.5.11) The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by breathing air, for as it is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the Lord has the omnipotence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other senses. In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can impregnate by His eyes. In fact, it is said that He glanced over material nature and thus fathered all living entities. After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in the Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to Godhead. We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature are all eager for material enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy one\u2019s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called enjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation; therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of yaj\u00f1a by becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.

The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods. Therefore, the yaj\u00f1as are directly aimed at the particular demigods mentioned in the Vedas. Indirectly, it is the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, because when one masters the performance of yaj\u00f1as one is sure to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.

The Lord instructs that one has to become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious to discharge duties, as if in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little difficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living entity cannot be happy independent of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord, because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to the desires of the Lord. Arjuna was therefore ordered by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to fight as if the Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice everything for the good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship.

That is the real purport of mayi, or \u201cunto Me.\u201d And when one acts in such K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything. This consciousness is called nirmama, or \u201cnothing is mine.\u201d And if there is any reluctance to execute such a stern order, which is without consideration of so-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown off; in this way one may become vigata-jvara, or without feverish mentality or lethargy. Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type of work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as described above.

But those who are not in such consciousness should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by the sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties. According to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex relationships with any women other than one\u2019s wife. All other women are to be considered as one\u2019s mother. But in spite of such injunctions, a man is still inclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to be curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should not rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and regulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratification under regulations may also lead one to go astray \u2013 as much as there is always the chance of an accident, even on the royal roads.

Spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master for the transcendental service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But whether material or spiritual, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another\u2019s prescribed duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may be different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always good for the performer. When one is under the spell of the modes of material nature, one should follow the prescribed rules for his particular situation and should not imitate others. For example, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a k\u1e63atriya, who is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for a k\u1e63atriya it is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a br\u0101hma\u1e47a who follows the principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends the modes of material nature and is fully situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he can perform anything and everything under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master. In that complete stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the k\u1e63atriya may act as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or a br\u0101hma\u1e47a may act as a k\u1e63atriya.

Then again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the mode of passion, instead of being degraded into the mode of ignorance, is elevated to the mode of goodness by the prescribed method of living and acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.\n\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is created by the Lord to give facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these lustful propensities, and when completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.\n\nThis inquiry is the beginning of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, wherein it is said, ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101: one should inquire into the Supreme.

In other words, when the living entity exhibits his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire covered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there is smoke, there is no overt manifestation of fire in the early stage. This stage is like the beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of the mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods. The best process is to chant the holy names of the Lord. The embryo covered by the womb is an analogy illustrating a helpless position, for the child in the womb is so helpless that he cannot even move. This stage of living condition can be compared to that of the trees. The trees are also living entities, but they have been put in such a condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void of all consciousness.

By careful handling of the smoke in the fire, fire can be made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence.

Vij\u00f1\u0101na refers to specific knowledge of the spirit soul\u2019s constitutional position and his relationship to the Supreme Soul.

The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. So, from the very beginning of life one has to learn this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thereby one may become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and act accordingly.\n\nLust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for every living entity. But if one is educated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness from the very beginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of God deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal condition. Nonetheless, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of devotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of understanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of Godhead \u2013 the highest perfectional stage of human life."}, {"verse": "TEXT 42", "devanagari": "\u0907\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0923\u093f \u092a\u0930\u093e\u0923\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0930\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0947\u092d\u094d\u092f\u0903 \u092a\u0930\u0902 \u092e\u0928\u0903 \u0964\n\u092e\u0928\u0938\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u092a\u0930\u093e \u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b \u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0947\u0903 \u092a\u0930\u0924\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u0938\u0903 \u0965 \u096a\u0968 \u0965", "verse-text": "indriy\u0101\u1e47i par\u0101\u1e47y \u0101hur\nindriyebhya\u1e25 para\u1e41 mana\u1e25\nmanasas tu par\u0101 buddhir\nyo buddhe\u1e25 paratas tu sa\u1e25", "synonyms": "indriy\u0101\u1e47i \u2014 senses; par\u0101\u1e47i \u2014 superior; \u0101hu\u1e25 \u2014 are said; indriyebhya\u1e25 \u2014 more than the senses; param \u2014 superior; mana\u1e25 \u2014 the mind; manasa\u1e25 \u2014 more than the mind; tu \u2014 also; par\u0101 \u2014 superior; buddhi\u1e25 \u2014 intelligence; ya\u1e25 \u2014 who; buddhe\u1e25 \u2014 more than the intelligence; parata\u1e25 \u2014 superior; tu \u2014 but; sa\u1e25 \u2014 he.", "translation": "The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher than the intelligence.", "purport": "The senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved within the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses are superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is superior consciousness, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness the soul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the hierarchy of bodily functions, as described here, ultimately ends in the Supreme Soul. Bodily action means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will act \u2013 as it does during dreaming. But above the mind is the determination of the intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence, mind and senses, will be automatically engaged. In the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad there is a similar passage, in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are superior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If, therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly, then there is no chance that the senses will become engaged in other ways. This mental attitude has already been explained. Para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate. If the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities. In the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad the soul has been described as mah\u0101n, the great. Therefore the soul is above all \u2013 namely, the sense objects, the senses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem.\n\nWith intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul and then engage the mind always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That solves the whole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the objects of the senses. But aside from that, one has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by intelligence one engages one\u2019s mind in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, by complete surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though the soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still, unless it is strengthened by association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind."}, {"verse": "TEXT 43", "devanagari": "\u090f\u0935\u0902 \u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0947\u0903 \u092a\u0930\u0902 \u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u094d\u0935\u093e \u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0924\u092d\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093e \u0964\n\u091c\u0939\u093f \u0936\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0902 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u092c\u093e\u0939\u094b \u0915\u093e\u092e\u0930\u0942\u092a\u0902 \u0926\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0938\u0926\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u096a\u0969 \u0965", "verse-text": "eva\u1e41 buddhe\u1e25 para\u1e41 buddhv\u0101\nsa\u1e41stabhy\u0101tm\u0101nam \u0101tman\u0101\njahi \u015batru\u1e41 mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\nk\u0101ma-r\u016bpa\u1e41 dur\u0101sadam", "synonyms": "evam \u2014 thus; buddhe\u1e25 \u2014 to intelligence; param \u2014 superior; buddhv\u0101 \u2014 knowing; sa\u1e41stabhya \u2014 by steadying; \u0101tm\u0101nam \u2014 the mind; \u0101tman\u0101 \u2014 by deliberate intelligence; jahi \u2014 conquer; \u015batrum \u2014 the enemy; mah\u0101-b\u0101ho \u2014 O mighty-armed one; k\u0101ma-r\u016bpam \u2014 in the form of lust; dur\u0101sadam \u2014 formidable.", "translation": "Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to the material senses, mind and intelligence, O mighty-armed Arjuna, one should steady the mind by deliberate spiritual intelligence [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness] and thus \u2013 by spiritual strength \u2013 conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust.", "purport": "This Third Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is conclusively directive to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by knowing oneself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without considering impersonal voidness the ultimate end.

The kings of all planets are especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants, and therefore the royal order should understand the science of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to impart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other words, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science and pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life.\n\nIn this millennium, the sun-god is known as Vivasv\u0101n, the king of the sun, which is the origin of all planets within the solar system. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.52) it is stated:\n\n\u201cLet me worship,\u201d Lord Brahm\u0101 said, \u201cthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], who is the original person and under whose order the sun, which is the king of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat. The sun represents the eye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in obedience to His order.\u201d\n\nThe sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name Vivasv\u0101n) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by supplying heat and light. He is rotating under the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a originally made Vivasv\u0101n His first disciple to understand the science of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The G\u012bt\u0101 is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down from time immemorial.\n\nIn the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (\u015a\u0101nti-parva 348.51\u201352) we can trace out the history of the G\u012bt\u0101 as follows:\n\n\u201cIn the beginning of the millennium known as Tret\u0101-yuga this science of the relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasv\u0101n to Manu. Manu, being the father of mankind, gave it to his son Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, the king of this earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty, in which Lord R\u0101macandra appeared.\u201d Therefore, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 existed in human society from the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku.\n\nAt the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dv\u0101para-yuga (800,000 years), and before that there was Tret\u0101-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus, some 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to his disciple and son Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, the king of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed. Accepting that before the birth of Manu the G\u012bt\u0101 was spoken by the Lord to His disciple the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n, a rough estimate is that the G\u012bt\u0101 was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand years ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the G\u012bt\u0101, according to the G\u012bt\u0101 itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It was spoken to the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n because he is also a k\u1e63atriya and is the father of all k\u1e63atriyas who are descendants of the sun-god, or the s\u016brya-va\u1e41\u015ba k\u1e63atriyas. Because Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is as good as the Vedas, being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauru\u1e63eya, superhuman. Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation, the G\u012bt\u0101 must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation. The mundane wranglers may speculate on the G\u012bt\u0101 in their own ways, but that is not Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is. Therefore, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 has to be accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku."}, {"verse": "TEXT 2", "devanagari": "\u090f\u0935\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0930\u093e\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092a\u094d\u0924\u092e\u093f\u092e\u0902 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0930\u094d\u0937\u092f\u094b \u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941\u0903 \u0964\n\u0938 \u0915\u093e\u0932\u0947\u0928\u0947\u0939 \u092e\u0939\u0924\u093e \u092f\u094b\u0917\u0947 \u0928\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0903 \u092a\u0930\u0928\u094d\u0924\u092a \u0965 \u0968 \u0965", "verse-text": "eva\u1e41 parampar\u0101-pr\u0101ptam\nima\u1e41 r\u0101jar\u1e63ayo vidu\u1e25\nsa k\u0101leneha mahat\u0101\nyogo na\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 paran-tapa", "synonyms": "evam \u2014 thus; parampar\u0101 \u2014 by disciplic succession; pr\u0101ptam \u2014 received; imam \u2014 this science; r\u0101ja-\u1e5b\u1e63aya\u1e25 \u2014 the saintly kings; vidu\u1e25 \u2014 understood; sa\u1e25 \u2014 that knowledge; k\u0101lena \u2014 in the course of time; iha \u2014 in this world; mahat\u0101 \u2014 great; yoga\u1e25 \u2014 the science of one\u2019s relationship with the Supreme; na\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 \u2014 scattered; param-tapa \u2014 O Arjuna, subduer of the enemies.", "translation": "This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way.

As soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He declared that the purpose of the G\u012bt\u0101 appeared to be lost. In the same way, at the present moment also there are so many editions of the G\u012bt\u0101 (especially in English), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic succession.

How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?", "purport": "Arjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As it will be evident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in transcendence. Of course, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also appeared as the son of Devak\u012b on this earth. How K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this question before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so that He Himself could speak authoritatively. That K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not only at present but from time immemorial, and the demons alone reject Him. Anyway, since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would describe Himself without being depicted by the demons, who always try to distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such explanations by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always study K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when they are spoken by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. The devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because they are always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is superhuman, that He is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha \u2013 the eternal form of bliss and knowledge \u2013 that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna\u2019s putting this question before the Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary human being, subject to the modes of material nature."}, {"verse": "TEXT 5", "devanagari": "\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0935\u093e\u091a\n\u092c\u0939\u0942\u0928\u093f \u092e\u0947 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0940\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093f \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093f \u0924\u0935 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0941\u0928 \u0964\n\u0924\u093e\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0939\u0902 \u0935\u0947\u0926 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0928 \u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u0935\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0925 \u092a\u0930\u0928\u094d\u0924\u092a \u0965 \u096b \u0965", "verse-text": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\nbah\u016bni me vyat\u012bt\u0101ni\njanm\u0101ni tava c\u0101rjuna\nt\u0101ny aha\u1e41 veda sarv\u0101\u1e47i\nna tva\u1e41 vettha paran-tapa", "synonyms": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca \u2014 the Personality of Godhead said; bah\u016bni \u2014 many; me \u2014 of Mine; vyat\u012bt\u0101ni \u2014 have passed; janm\u0101ni \u2014 births; tava \u2014 of yours; ca \u2014 and also; arjuna \u2014 O Arjuna; t\u0101ni \u2014 those; aham \u2014 I; veda \u2014 do know; sarv\u0101\u1e47i \u2014 all; na \u2014 not; tvam \u2014 you; vettha \u2014 know; param-tapa \u2014 O subduer of the enemy.", "translation": "The Personality of Godhead said: Many, many births both you and I have passed.

Although expanded into unlimited forms, He is still the same original, the oldest, and the person always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord are usually not understood by even the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.\u201d\n\nIt is also stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.39):\n\n\u201cI worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], who is always situated in various incarnations such as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha and many subincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and who incarnates personally also.\u201d\n\nIn the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the vaid\u016brya stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multiforms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the Vedas (vede\u1e63u durlabham adurlabham \u0101tma-bhaktau). Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities. Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incident whereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part-and-parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 as infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the G\u012bt\u0101 cannot be understood by demonic brains. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His sac-cid-\u0101nanda body. He is advaita, which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit \u2013 whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And because the Lord\u2019s body and self are identical, His position is always different from that of the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform. The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord, which the Lord Himself explains in the following verse."}, {"verse": "TEXT 6", "devanagari": "\u0905\u091c\u094b\u093d\u092a\u093f \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0928\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e \u092d\u0942\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u0940\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094b\u093d\u092a\u093f \u0938\u0928\u094d \u0964\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0902 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092e\u0927\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u092f \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u092e\u093e\u092f\u092f\u093e \u0965 \u096c \u0965", "verse-text": "ajo \u2019pi sann avyay\u0101tm\u0101\nbh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m \u012b\u015bvaro \u2019pi san\nprak\u1e5bti\u1e41 sv\u0101m adhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ya\nsambhav\u0101my \u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101", "synonyms": "aja\u1e25 \u2014 unborn; api \u2014 although; san \u2014 being so; avyaya \u2014 without deterioration; \u0101tm\u0101 \u2014 body; bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m \u2014 of all those who are born; \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 \u2014 the Supreme Lord; api \u2014 although; san \u2014 being so; prak\u1e5btim \u2014 in the transcendental form; sv\u0101m \u2014 of Myself; adhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ya \u2014 being so situated; sambhav\u0101mi \u2014 I do incarnate; \u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101 \u2014 by My internal energy.", "translation": "Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all living entities, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form.", "purport": "The Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may appear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past \u201cbirths,\u201d whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours before. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains His prak\u1e5bti, or His form. Prak\u1e5bti means \u201cnature,\u201d as well as svar\u016bpa, or \u201cone\u2019s own form.\u201d The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. And although His body does not deteriorate like a material body, it still appears that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth. But astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, He had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-five years old. We never see a picture of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation \u2013 past, present and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance are like the sun\u2019s rising, moving before us and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that the sun has set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency \u2013 and He is never contaminated by material nature. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn yet He still appears to take His birth in multimanifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of body. In the Bh\u0101gavatam, He appears before His mother as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, bestowed upon the living entities so that they can concentrate on the Supreme Lord as He is, and not on mental concoctions or imaginations, which the impersonalist wrongly thinks the Lord\u2019s forms to be. The word m\u0101y\u0101, or \u0101tma-m\u0101y\u0101, refers to the Lord\u2019s causeless mercy, according to the Vi\u015bva-ko\u015ba dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A question may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this world.

S\u1e5bj\u0101mi cannot be used in the sense of creation, because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the Lord\u2019s form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore, s\u1e5bj\u0101mi means that the Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord appears on schedule, namely at the end of the Dv\u0101para-yuga of the twenty-eighth millennium of the seventh Manu in one day of Brahm\u0101, He has no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations, because He is completely free to act in many ways at His will. He therefore appears by His own will whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion. Principles of religion are laid down in the Vedas, and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the Vedas makes one irreligious. In the Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the Lord can manufacture a system of religion. The Vedas are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahm\u0101, from within his heart. Therefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam). These principles are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The purpose of the Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the G\u012bt\u0101, that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and whenever such principles are disturbed by the demoniac, the Lord appears. From the Bh\u0101gavatam we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the Vedas. Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles. Lord Buddha appeared in order to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and every avat\u0101ra, or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an avat\u0101ra unless he is referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil. He can manifest Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But the mission is the same \u2013 to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised form.\n\nThe principles of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true in the beginner\u2019s arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lower mathematics. In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are taught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The higher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is to arouse K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness everywhere. Such consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances."}, {"verse": "TEXT 8", "devanagari": "\u092a\u0930\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093e\u092f \u0938\u093e\u0927\u0941\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0936\u093e\u092f \u091a \u0926\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093e\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093e\u092f \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935\u093e\u092e\u093f \u092f\u0941\u0917\u0947 \u092f\u0941\u0917\u0947 \u0965 \u096e \u0965", "verse-text": "paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41\nvin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m\ndharma-sa\u1e41sth\u0101pan\u0101rth\u0101ya\nsambhav\u0101mi yuge yuge", "synonyms": "paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya \u2014 for the deliverance; s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101m \u2014 of the devotees; vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya \u2014 for the annihilation; ca \u2014 and; du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m \u2014 of the miscreants; dharma \u2014 principles of religion; sa\u1e41sth\u0101pana-arth\u0101ya \u2014 to reestablish; sambhav\u0101mi \u2014 I do appear; yuge \u2014 millennium; yuge \u2014 after millennium.", "translation": "To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear, millennium after millennium.", "purport": "According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, a s\u0101dhu (holy man) is a man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a s\u0101dhu. And du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m applies to those who do not care for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such miscreants, or du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m, are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education, whereas a person who is one hundred percent engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is accepted as a s\u0101dhu, even though such a person may be neither learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons R\u0101va\u1e47a and Ka\u1e41sa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demoniac. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was the son of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devak\u012b, the mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was the sister of Ka\u1e41sa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was to be born of them. So Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared primarily to deliver Devak\u012b rather than kill Ka\u1e41sa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.\n\nIn the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja, the following verses (Madhya 20.263\u2013264) summarize these principles of incarnation:\n\n\u201cThe avat\u0101ra, or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or avat\u0101ra. Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the material creation, they assume the name avat\u0101ra.\u201d\n\nThere are various kinds of avat\u0101ras, such as puru\u1e63\u0101vat\u0101ras, gu\u1e47\u0101vat\u0101ras, l\u012bl\u0101vat\u0101ras, \u015bakty-\u0101ve\u015ba avat\u0101ras, manvantara-avat\u0101ras and yug\u0101vat\u0101ras \u2013 all appearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the primeval Lord, the fountainhead of all avat\u0101ras. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends for the specific purpose of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a avat\u0101ra is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.\n\nThe Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates that He incarnates also in the Age of Kali. As stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the incarnation in the Age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who spread the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement (congregational chanting of the holy names) and spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village.

One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the Personality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and therefore he returns to the kingdom of God immediately after quitting this present material body. Such liberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy. The impersonalists and the yog\u012bs attain liberation only after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the liberation they achieve \u2013 merging into the impersonal brahma-jyotir of the Lord \u2013 is only partial, and there is the risk of returning to this material world. But the devotee, simply by understanding the transcendental nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode of the Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning to this material world. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.33) it is stated that the Lord has many, many forms and incarnations: advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam. Although there are many transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with conviction, although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric philosophers. As stated in the Vedas (Puru\u1e63a-bodhin\u012b Upani\u1e63ad):\n\n\u201cThe one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many, many transcendental forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees.\u201d This Vedic version is confirmed in this verse of the G\u012bt\u0101 personally by the Lord. He who accepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the Vedas and of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical speculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation. Simply by accepting this truth on faith, one can, without a doubt, attain liberation. The Vedic version tat tvam asi is actually applied in this case. Anyone who understands Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord, \u201cYou are the same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead,\u201d is certainly liberated instantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of the Lord is guaranteed. In other words, such a faithful devotee of the Lord attains perfection, and this is confirmed by the following Vedic assertion:\n\n\u201cOne can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by knowing the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there is no other way to achieve this perfection.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 3.8) That there is no alternative means that anyone who does not understand Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance and consequently he will not attain salvation simply, so to speak, by licking the outer surface of the bottle of honey, or by interpreting the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 according to mundane scholarship. Such empiric philosophers may assume very important roles in the material world, but they are not necessarily eligible for liberation. Such puffed-up mundane scholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of the Lord. One should therefore cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with faith and knowledge, and in this way attain perfection."}, {"verse": "TEXT 10", "devanagari": "\u0935\u0940\u0924\u0930\u093e\u0917\u092d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0927\u093e \u092e\u0928\u094d\u092e\u092f\u093e \u092e\u093e\u092e\u0941\u092a\u093e\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0903 \u0964\n\u092c\u0939\u0935\u094b \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0924\u092a\u0938\u093e \u092a\u0942\u0924\u093e \u092e\u0926\u094d\u092d\u200d\u093e\u0935\u092e\u093e\u0917\u0924\u093e\u0903 \u0965 \u0967\u0966 \u0965", "verse-text": "v\u012bta-r\u0101ga-bhaya-krodh\u0101\nman-may\u0101 m\u0101m up\u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25\nbahavo j\u00f1\u0101na-tapas\u0101\np\u016bt\u0101 mad-bh\u0101vam \u0101gat\u0101\u1e25", "synonyms": "v\u012bta \u2014 freed from; r\u0101ga \u2014 attachment; bhaya \u2014 fear; krodh\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 and anger; mat-may\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 fully in Me; m\u0101m \u2014 in Me; up\u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 being fully situated; bahava\u1e25 \u2014 many; j\u00f1\u0101na \u2014 of knowledge; tapas\u0101 \u2014 by the penance; p\u016bt\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 being purified; mat-bh\u0101vam \u2014 transcendental love for Me; \u0101gat\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 attained.", "translation": "Being freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and taking refuge in Me, many, many persons in the past became purified by knowledge of Me \u2013 and thus they all attained transcendental love for Me.", "purport": "As described above, it is very difficult for a person who is too materially affected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Generally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand how the Supreme can be a person. Such materialists cannot even imagine that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and eternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full of ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material manifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be impersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality. This is a kind of fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at all. Being embarrassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void. Such people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people are too materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in everything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness. This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of material consciousness: attachment to material life, fear of a spiritual personal identity, and the conception of void that arises from frustration in life. To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master, and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last stage of the devotional life is called bh\u0101va, or transcendental love of Godhead.\n\nAccording to Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.4.15\u201316), the science of devotional service:\n\n\u201cIn the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. This will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are spiritually elevated. In the next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional service. By execution of devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material attachment, attains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for hearing about the Absolute Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This taste leads one further forward to attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is matured in bh\u0101va, or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of God. Real love for God is called prema, the highest perfectional stage of life.\u201d In the prema stage there is constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. So, by the slow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being freed from all material attachment, from the fearfulness of one\u2019s individual spiritual personality, and from the frustrations that result in void philosophy. Then one can ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord."}, {"verse": "TEXT 11", "devanagari": "\u092f\u0947 \u092f\u0925\u093e \u092e\u093e\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092a\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0924\u093e\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0925\u0948\u0935 \u092d\u091c\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0939\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u092e\u092e \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u092e\u0928\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0936\u0903 \u0965 \u0967\u0967 \u0965", "verse-text": "ye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante\nt\u0101\u1e41s tathaiva bhaj\u0101my aham\nmama vartm\u0101nuvartante\nmanu\u1e63y\u0101\u1e25 p\u0101rtha sarva\u015ba\u1e25", "synonyms": "ye \u2014 all who; yath\u0101 \u2014 as; m\u0101m \u2014 unto Me; prapadyante \u2014 surrender; t\u0101n \u2014 them; tath\u0101 \u2014 so; eva \u2014 certainly; bhaj\u0101mi \u2014 reward; aham \u2014 I; mama \u2014 My; vartma \u2014 path; anuvartante \u2014 follow; manu\u1e63y\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 all men; p\u0101rtha \u2014 O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; sarva\u015ba\u1e25 \u2014 in all respects.", "translation": "As all surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly.

But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is fully realized only by His pure devotees. Consequently, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the object of everyone\u2019s realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied according to one\u2019s desire to have Him. In the transcendental world also, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One devotee may want K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as supreme master, another as his personal friend, another as his son and still another as his lover. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a rewards all the devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual existence of the living entity, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a helps also by absorbing them into His effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their individuality. Some of them, who are not firmly situated even in the impersonal existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for activities. They are not admitted into the spiritual planets, but they are again given a chance to act on the material planets.

The Supreme God is one \u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods are all living entities (nity\u0101n\u0101m) with different grades of material power. They cannot be equal to the Supreme God \u2013 N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Anyone who thinks that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b. Even the great demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva (\u015biva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism. Iha devat\u0101\u1e25 denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world. But N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation. Even \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people (h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101na) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some immediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this material world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods and their worshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, people worship the demigods or powerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or \u201cbig guns\u201d in order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such foolish men are not interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence.

Everything is born of Him, everything is sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. He is therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with the intelligent class of men, technically called br\u0101hma\u1e47as due to their being situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative class, technically called the k\u1e63atriyas due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The mercantile men, called the vai\u015byas, are situated in the mixed modes of passion and ignorance, and the \u015b\u016bdras, or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human society, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the animal status, the above-mentioned divisions are created by the Lord for the systematic development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to the different modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, is above even the br\u0101hma\u1e47as.

He creates and remains aloof from the creation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material resources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For advancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires the low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the material actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for different types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic sm\u1e5bti confirms this fact as follows:\n\n\u201cIn the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The immediate cause is material nature, by which the cosmic manifestation is made visible.\u201d The created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good or bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never responsible for their past and present activities.

The living entity is responsible for his own acts. The Lord only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature, the external energy. Anyone who is fully conversant with all the intricacies of this law of karma, or fruitive activities, does not become affected by the results of his activities. In other words, the person who understands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma. One who does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the activities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of the ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive reactions.

A conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as set forth here in the G\u012bt\u0101. This process is generally known as yaj\u00f1a, or activities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The more the activities of the material world are performed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption. The word brahma (Brahman) means \u201cspiritual.\u201d The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called brahma-jyotir, His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in that brahma-jyotir, but when the jyotir is covered by illusion (m\u0101y\u0101) or sense gratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or contribution, the process of consumption, the contributor and the result are \u2013 all combined together \u2013 Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by m\u0101y\u0101 is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is said to be in sam\u0101dhi, or trance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yaj\u00f1a, or sacrifice for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the contributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the performance and the result or ultimate gain \u2013 everything \u2013 becomes one in the Absolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}, {"verse": "TEXT 25", "devanagari": "\u0926\u0948\u0935\u092e\u0947\u0935\u093e\u092a\u0930\u0947 \u092f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0902 \u092f\u094b\u0917\u093f\u0928\u0903 \u092a\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0941\u092a\u093e\u0938\u0924\u0947 \u0964\n\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0917\u094d\u0928\u200d\u093e\u0935\u092a\u0930\u0947 \u092f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0902 \u092f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0947\u0928\u0948\u0935\u094b\u092a\u091c\u0941\u0939\u094d\u0935\u0924\u093f \u0965 \u0968\u096b \u0965", "verse-text": "daivam ev\u0101pare yaj\u00f1a\u1e41\nyogina\u1e25 paryup\u0101sate\nbrahm\u0101gn\u0101v apare yaj\u00f1a\u1e41\nyaj\u00f1enaivopajuhvati", "synonyms": "daivam \u2014 in worshiping the demigods; eva \u2014 like this; apare \u2014 some others; yaj\u00f1am \u2014 sacrifices; yogina\u1e25 \u2014 mystics; paryup\u0101sate \u2014 worship perfectly; brahma \u2014 of the Absolute Truth; agnau \u2014 in the fire; apare \u2014 others; yaj\u00f1am \u2014 sacrifice; yaj\u00f1ena \u2014 by sacrifice; eva \u2014 thus; upajuhvati \u2014 offer.", "translation": "Some yog\u012bs perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacrifices to them, and some offer sacrifices in the fire of the Supreme Brahman.", "purport": "As described above, a person engaged in discharging duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is also called a perfect yog\u012b or a first-class mystic. But there are others also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, and still others who sacrifice to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacrifices in terms of different categories. Such different categories of sacrifice by different types of performers only superficially demark varieties of sacrifice. Factually sacrifice means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is also known as Yaj\u00f1a. All the different varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary divisions: namely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of transcendental knowledge. Those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness sacrifice all material possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who want some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material possessions to satisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who are impersonalists, sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of impersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like the heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the Vedic rituals. They are called bahv-\u012b\u015bvara-v\u0101d\u012b, or believers in many gods. But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their individual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the existence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists sacrifice their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme. In other words, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme Brahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of Brahman. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus all his material possessions as well as his own self \u2013 everything \u2013 is sacrificed for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

The brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, or students under the care of a bona fide spiritual master, control the mind by abstaining from sense gratification. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b hears only words concerning K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; hearing is the basic principle for understanding, and therefore the pure brahmac\u0101r\u012b engages fully in harer n\u0101m\u0101nuk\u012brtanam \u2013 chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord.

Similarly, the householders, who have some license for sense gratification, perform such acts with great restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat-eating are general tendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in unrestricted sex life and other sense gratification. Marriage on the principles of religious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that is the way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also a kind of yaj\u00f1a because the restricted householder sacrifices his general tendency toward sense gratification for higher, transcendental life."}, {"verse": "TEXT 27", "devanagari": "\u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0923\u0940\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923\u093f \u091a\u093e\u092a\u0930\u0947 \u0964\n\u0906\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0938\u0902\u092f\u092e\u092f\u094b\u0917\u093e\u0917\u094d\u0928\u200d\u094c \u091c\u0941\u0939\u094d\u0935\u0924\u093f \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0926\u0940\u092a\u093f\u0924\u0947 \u0965 \u0968\u096d \u0965", "verse-text": "sarv\u0101\u1e47\u012bndriya-karm\u0101\u1e47i\npr\u0101\u1e47a-karm\u0101\u1e47i c\u0101pare\n\u0101tma-sa\u1e41yama-yog\u0101gnau\njuhvati j\u00f1\u0101na-d\u012bpite", "synonyms": "sarv\u0101\u1e47i \u2014 of all; indriya \u2014 the senses; karm\u0101\u1e47i \u2014 functions; pr\u0101\u1e47a-karm\u0101\u1e47i \u2014 functions of the life breath; ca \u2014 also; apare \u2014 others; \u0101tma-sa\u1e41yama \u2014 of controlling the mind; yoga \u2014 the linking process; agnau \u2014 in the fire of; juhvati \u2014 offer; j\u00f1\u0101na-d\u012bpite \u2014 because of the urge for self-realization.", "translation": "Others, who are interested in achieving self-realization through control of the mind and senses, offer the functions of all the senses, and of the life breath, as oblations into the fire of the controlled mind.", "purport": "The yoga system conceived by Pata\u00f1jali is referred to herein.

As long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called par\u0101g-\u0101tm\u0101, but as soon as the same soul becomes detached from such sense enjoyment it is called pratyag-\u0101tm\u0101. The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The Pata\u00f1jali system of yoga instructs one on how to control the functions of the body\u2019s air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment. According to this yoga system, pratyag-\u0101tm\u0101 is the ultimate goal. This pratyag-\u0101tm\u0101 is withdrawn from activities in matter. The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, and hand for touching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self. They are called the functions of the pr\u0101\u1e47a-v\u0101yu.

In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age homes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food, education and medical treatment free to the poor. All these charitable activities are called dravyamaya-yaj\u00f1a. There are others who, for higher elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe, voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as candr\u0101ya\u1e47a and c\u0101turm\u0101sya. These processes entail severe vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules. For example, under the c\u0101turm\u0101sya vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year (July to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a day or does not leave home. Such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called tapomaya-yaj\u00f1a. There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic yogas like the Pata\u00f1jali system (for merging into the existence of the Absolute), or ha\u1e6dha-yoga or a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga (for particular perfections). And some travel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage. All these practices are called yoga-yaj\u00f1a, sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material world. There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different Vedic literatures, specifically the Upani\u1e63ads and Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, or the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy. All of these are called sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya-yaj\u00f1a, or engagement in the sacrifice of studies. All these yog\u012bs are faithfully engaged in different types of sacrifice and are seeking a higher status of life.

No one can be a bona fide spiritual master without following this principle of disciplic succession.

No one can be spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish pretenders.

Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help lead one to the right path. Nor by independent study of books of knowledge can one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. Not only should one hear submissively from the spiritual master, but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona fide spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple.

The sense of an existence separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called m\u0101y\u0101 (m\u0101 \u2013 not, y\u0101 \u2013 this). Some think that we have nothing to do with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is only a great historical personality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, this impersonal Brahman is the personal effulgence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is clearly stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His different expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers wrongly think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed, loses its own original identity. But the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers fail to understand that absolute means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world.\n\nFor want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although we are separated parts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we are nevertheless not different from Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is m\u0101y\u0101, or not actual fact. We are all meant to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By m\u0101y\u0101 alone Arjuna thought that the temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The whole teaching of the G\u012bt\u0101 is targeted toward this end: that a living being, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s eternal servitor, cannot be separated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and his sense of being an identity apart from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called m\u0101y\u0101. The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Having forgotten that purpose since time immemorial, they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one is engaged in transcendental service through K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the supreme shelter for all living entities, and giving up such shelter, the living entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus, under different standards of material identity, they become forgetful of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When, however, such deluded living entities become situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as confirmed in the Bh\u0101gavatam (2.10.6): muktir hitv\u0101nyath\u0101-r\u016bpa\u1e41 svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25. Liberation means to be situated in one\u2019s constitutional position as an eternal servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness)."}, {"verse": "TEXT 36", "devanagari": "\u0905\u092a\u093f \u091a\u0947\u0926\u0938\u093f \u092a\u093e\u092a\u0947\u092d\u094d\u092f\u0903 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u092d\u094d\u092f\u0903 \u092a\u093e\u092a\u0915\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e\u0903 \u0964\n\u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u092a\u094d\u0932\u200d\u0935\u0947\u0928\u0948\u0935 \u0935\u0943\u091c\u093f\u0928\u0902 \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0938\u093f \u0965 \u0969\u096c \u0965", "verse-text": "api ced asi p\u0101pebhya\u1e25\nsarvebhya\u1e25 p\u0101pa-k\u1e5bt-tama\u1e25\nsarva\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-plavenaiva\nv\u1e5bjina\u1e41 santari\u1e63yasi", "synonyms": "api \u2014 even; cet \u2014 if; asi \u2014 you are; p\u0101pebhya\u1e25 \u2014 of sinners; sarvebhya\u1e25 \u2014 of all; p\u0101pa-k\u1e5bt-tama\u1e25 \u2014 the greatest sinner; sarvam \u2014 all such sinful reactions; j\u00f1\u0101na-plavena \u2014 by the boat of transcendental knowledge; eva \u2014 certainly; v\u1e5bjinam \u2014 the ocean of miseries; santari\u1e63yasi \u2014 you will cross completely.", "translation": "Even if you are considered to be the most sinful of all sinners, when you are situated in the boat of transcendental knowledge you will be able to cross over the ocean of miseries.", "purport": "Proper understanding of one\u2019s constitutional position in relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so nice that it can at once lift one from the struggle for existence which goes on in the ocean of nescience.

Armed with yoga, O Bh\u0101rata, stand and fight.", "purport": "The yoga system instructed in this chapter is called san\u0101tana-yoga, or eternal activities performed by the living entity. This yoga has two divisions of sacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one\u2019s material possessions, and the other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacrifice of one\u2019s material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization, then such sacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such sacrifices with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect sacrifice. When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also divided into two: namely, understanding of one\u2019s own self (or one\u2019s constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who follows the path of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the Lord. And such understanding is beneficial, for such a person can easily understand the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of the G\u012bt\u0101 is faithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of Godhead is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in forgoing material possessions, in studying the Vedas and in partaking of the social institution called var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them are based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, but one who doubts the authority of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a falls back. One is therefore advised to study Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, or any other scripture, under a bona fide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 have come down to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is expressed in the G\u012bt\u0101 itself and beware of self-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path. The Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are transcendental. One who understands this is a liberated person from the very beginning of his study of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101."}], "desc": ""}, {"name": "Chapter Five: Karma-yoga \u2013 Action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Consciousness", "link": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/5/advanced-view", "verses": [{"verse": "TEXT 1", "devanagari": "\u0905\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0941\u0928 \u0909\u0935\u093e\u091a\n\u0938\u0928\u094d\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0902 \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0923\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923 \u092a\u0941\u0928\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0917\u0902 \u091a \u0936\u0902\u0938\u0938\u093f \u0964\n\u092f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092f \u090f\u0924\u092f\u094b\u0930\u0947\u0915\u0902 \u0924\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0947 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0942\u0939\u093f \u0938\u0941\u0928\u093f\u0936\u094d\u091a\u093f\u0924\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0967 \u0965", "verse-text": "arjuna uv\u0101ca\nsanny\u0101sa\u1e41 karma\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\npunar yoga\u1e41 ca \u015ba\u1e41sasi\nyac chreya etayor eka\u1e41\ntan me br\u016bhi su-ni\u015bcitam", "synonyms": "arjuna\u1e25 uv\u0101ca \u2014 Arjuna said; sanny\u0101sam \u2014 renunciation; karma\u1e47\u0101m \u2014 of all activities; k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; puna\u1e25 \u2014 again; yogam \u2014 devotional service; ca \u2014 also; \u015ba\u1e41sasi \u2014 You are praising; yat \u2014 which; \u015breya\u1e25 \u2014 is more beneficial; etayo\u1e25 \u2014 of these two; ekam \u2014 one; tat \u2014 that; me \u2014 unto me; br\u016bhi \u2014 please tell; su-ni\u015bcitam \u2014 definitely.", "translation": "Arjuna said: O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, first of all You ask me to renounce work, and then again You recommend work with devotion.

How to get out of this material encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained therein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And in the Fourth Chapter the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work culminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord advised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge. Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion and inaction in knowledge, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has perplexed Arjuna and confused his determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words, he thinks that sanny\u0101sa, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether free from all kinds of activity, because work and renunciation appear to him to be incompatible.

As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.5.4\u20136) confirms this as follows:\n\n\u201cPeople are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one\u2019s fruitive activities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about his real identity. As long as he does not know his real identity, he has to work for fruitive results for sense gratification, and as long as one is engrossed in the consciousness of sense gratification one has to transmigrate from one body to another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to V\u0101sudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of material existence.\u201d\n\nTherefore, j\u00f1\u0101na (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit soul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities performed in full knowledge strengthen one\u2019s advancement in real knowledge. Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of falling. Renunciation without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.258):\n\n\u201cWhen persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking them to be material, their renunciation is called incomplete.\u201d Renunciation is complete when it is in the knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim proprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows that everything is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s property is always situated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, everything should be employed in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This perfect form of action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation by a sanny\u0101s\u012b of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b school."}, {"verse": "TEXT 3", "devanagari": "\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0947\u092f: \u0938 \u0928\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0938\u0928\u094d\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0940 \u092f\u094b \u0928 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f \u0928 \u0915\u093e\u0919\u094d\u200d\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u093f \u0964\n\u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0935\u094b \u0939\u093f \u092e\u0939\u093e\u092c\u093e\u0939\u094b \u0938\u0941\u0916\u0902 \u092c\u0928\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0941\u091a\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0965 \u0969 \u0965", "verse-text": "j\u00f1eya\u1e25 sa nitya-sanny\u0101s\u012b\nyo na dve\u1e63\u1e6di na k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati\nnirdvandvo hi mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\nsukha\u1e41 bandh\u0101t pramucyate", "synonyms": "j\u00f1eya\u1e25 \u2014 should be known; sa\u1e25 \u2014 he; nitya \u2014 always; sanny\u0101s\u012b \u2014 renouncer; ya\u1e25 \u2014 who; na \u2014 never; dve\u1e63\u1e6di \u2014 abhors; na \u2014 nor; k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati \u2014 desires; nirdvandva\u1e25 \u2014 free from all dualities; hi \u2014 certainly; mah\u0101-b\u0101ho \u2014 O mighty-armed one; sukham \u2014 happily; bandh\u0101t \u2014 from bondage; pramucyate \u2014 is completely liberated.", "translation": "One who neither hates nor desires the fruits of his activities is known to be always renounced.

Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord.

Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as Param\u0101tm\u0101, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of conditioning for the living entity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the minute independent living entities. However, when one desires K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymns therefore declare, e\u1e63a u hy eva s\u0101dhu karma k\u0101rayati ta\u1e41 yam ebhyo lokebhya unnin\u012b\u1e63ate. e\u1e63a u ev\u0101s\u0101dhu karma k\u0101rayati yam adho nin\u012b\u1e63ate: \u201cThe Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so that he may be elevated. The Lord engages him in impious activities so that he may go to hell.\u201d (Kau\u1e63\u012btak\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 3.8)\n\n\u201cThe living entity is completely dependent in his distress and happiness. By the will of the Supreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the air.\u201d\n\nTherefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is constitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is thus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living entity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras (2.1.34) also confirm this.

Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is said in the Seventh Chapter, nineteenth verse: bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or when one attains K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as everything is revealed by the sun in the daytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he unceremoniously thinks himself God, he actually falls into the last snare of nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will certainly drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious spiritual master. One can know God and one\u2019s relationship with God only when one actually meets a representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living entity. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after liberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in day, when the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity.

When one is well situated in devotional service, one comes to the transcendental position, qualified to feel the presence of the Lord in the sphere of one\u2019s activity. This particular position is called liberation in the Supreme.\n\nAfter explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the Lord gives instruction to Arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the practice of the mysticism or yoga known as a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga, which is divisible into an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, dhy\u0101na and sam\u0101dhi. In the Sixth Chapter the subject of yoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily explained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell by the praty\u0101h\u0101ra process in yoga, and then keep the vision of the eyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of the nose with half-closed lids. There is no benefit in closing the eyes altogether, because then there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening the eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense objects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by neutralizing the up-moving and down-moving air within the body. By practice of such yoga one is able to gain control over the senses, refrain from outward sense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.\n\nThis yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger and thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga principles. This will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does not risk losing his senses to some other engagement.

But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101. In the Vedas (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.7) the Supreme Lord is described as tam \u012b\u015bvar\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 parama\u1e41 mahe\u015bvara\u1e41. Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nThis Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, generally known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how karma-yoga can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga is a path leading to bhakti-yoga. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one\u2019s relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with m\u0101y\u0101 (illusion) due to the desire to lord it over m\u0101y\u0101, and that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one\u2019s practical performance of duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which helps one control the senses in every respect and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And one who stands fast in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, controlling the abovementioned passions, remains factually in the transcendental stage, or brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a. The eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There is a gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, dhy\u0101na and sam\u0101dhi. But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life."}], "desc": ""}, {"name": "Chapter Six: Dhy\u0101na-yoga", "link": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/6/advanced-view", "verses": [{"verse": "TEXT 1", "devanagari": "\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0935\u093e\u091a\n\u0905\u0928\u093e\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924: \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u092b\u0932\u0902 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e \u0915\u0930\u094b\u0924\u093f \u092f: \u0964\n\u0938 \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0940 \u091a \u092f\u094b\u0917\u0940 \u091a \u0928 \u0928\u093f\u0930\u0917\u094d\u0928\u200d\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0928 \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f: \u0965 \u0967 \u0965", "verse-text": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\nan\u0101\u015brita\u1e25 karma-phala\u1e41\nk\u0101rya\u1e41 karma karoti ya\u1e25\nsa sanny\u0101s\u012b ca yog\u012b ca\nna niragnir na c\u0101kriya\u1e25", "synonyms": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca \u2014 the Lord said; an\u0101\u015brita\u1e25 \u2014 without taking shelter; karma-phalam \u2014 of the result of work; k\u0101ryam \u2014 obligatory; karma \u2014 work; karoti \u2014 performs; ya\u1e25 \u2014 one who; sa\u1e25 \u2014 he; sanny\u0101s\u012b \u2014 in the renounced order; ca \u2014 also; yog\u012b \u2014 mystic; ca \u2014 also; na \u2014 not; ni\u1e25 \u2014 without; agni\u1e25 \u2014 fire; na \u2014 nor; ca \u2014 also; akriya\u1e25 \u2014 without duty.", "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no duty.", "purport": "In this chapter the Lord explains that the process of the eightfold yoga system is a means to control the mind and the senses. However, this is very difficult for people in general to perform, especially in the Age of Kali. Although the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that the process of karma-yoga, or acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is better. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect sanny\u0101s\u012b, the perfect yog\u012b.\n\nThe sanny\u0101s\u012bs sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yaj\u00f1as (fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is to become one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any material desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yog\u012b who practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without self-interest. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His criterion of success is the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus he is the perfect sanny\u0101s\u012b, or perfect yog\u012b. Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of renunciation, prays in this way:\n\n\u201cO Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy beautiful women. Nor do I want any number of followers.

When he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory activities. This is practiced by the yog\u012bs who restrain the senses from material attachment. But a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is simultaneously a sanny\u0101s\u012b and a yog\u012b. The purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga processes, is automatically served in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is unable to give up the activities of his selfish nature, then j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga are of no avail. The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means, concisely, to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those who are attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are also partially K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, because the impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus the impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. A directly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee knows what is meant by Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101. His knowledge of the Absolute Truth is perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative yog\u012b are imperfectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.\n\nNevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and not forget Him even for a moment. Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is called sam\u0101dhi, or trance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects. He should be very careful to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization. And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.\n\nAll these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is directly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, because direct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means self-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b characterizes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in this way:\n\n\u201cWhen one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is rightly situated above possessiveness. On the other hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not as complete in his renunciation.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.255\u2013256)\n\nA K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person well knows that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus he is always free from feelings of personal possession. As such, he has no hankering for anything on his own personal account. He knows how to accept things in favor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He is always aloof from material things because he is always transcendental, and he is always alone, having nothing to do with persons not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

The yoga process is practiced in order to discover and see this localized form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and not for any other purpose. The localized vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti is the plenary representation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a dwelling within one\u2019s heart. One who has no program to realize this vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti is uselessly engaged in mock yoga practice and is certainly wasting his time. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate goal of life, and the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti situated in one\u2019s heart is the object of yoga practice. To realize this vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti within the heart, one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as mentioned above. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a so-called yoga class and thus become a yog\u012b. One has to practice controlling the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the chief. In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya it is said:\n\n\u201cThe vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex indulgence in work, words and mind \u2013 at all times, under all circumstances and in all places.\u201d No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence. Brahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood, when one has no knowledge of sex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the guru-kula, or the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the strict discipline of becoming brahmac\u0101r\u012bs. Without such practice, no one can make advancement in any yoga, whether it be dhy\u0101na, j\u00f1\u0101na or bhakti. One who, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having a sexual relationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called a brahmac\u0101r\u012b. Such a restrained householder brahmac\u0101r\u012b may be accepted in the bhakti school, but the j\u00f1\u0101na and dhy\u0101na schools do not even admit householder brahmac\u0101r\u012bs. They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the bhakti school, a householder brahmac\u0101r\u012b is allowed controlled sex life because the cult of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction, being engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.59) it is said:\n\nWhereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other than the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.\n\nVigata-bh\u012b\u1e25. One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Bh\u0101gavatam (11.2.37) says, bhaya\u1e41 dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101d \u012b\u015b\u0101d apetasya viparyayo \u2019sm\u1e5bti\u1e25.

Yoga practice is not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the cessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health or aspires after material perfection is no yog\u012b according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Nor does cessation of material existence entail one\u2019s entering into \u201cthe void,\u201d which is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord. Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the spiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The abode of the Lord is also clearly described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as that place where there is no need of sun, moon or electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are self-illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma, or superior abodes.\n\nA consummate yog\u012b, who is perfect in understanding Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is clearly stated herein by the Lord Himself (mat-citta\u1e25, mat-para\u1e25, mat-sth\u0101nam), can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, known as Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.37) it is clearly stated, goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25: the Lord, although residing always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 as well by dint of His superior spiritual energies. No one can reach the spiritual sky (Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha) or enter into the Lord\u2019s eternal abode (Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana) without the proper understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His plenary expansion Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore a person working in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the perfect yog\u012b, because his mind is always absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities (sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25).

Such simple foodstuff is considered to be in the mode of goodness according to the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Animal food is for those in the mode of ignorance.

In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness, realized through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.", "purport": "By practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after this, one becomes situated in trance, or sam\u0101dhi, which means that the yog\u012b realizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice is more or less based on the principles of the Pata\u00f1jali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Pata\u00f1jali system of yoga. There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the Pata\u00f1jali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure, out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure \u2013 realized through transcendental senses \u2013 is accepted. And this is corroborated by Pata\u00f1jali Muni, the famous exponent of the yoga system. The great sage declares in his Yoga-s\u016btras (4.33): puru\u1e63\u0101rtha-\u015b\u016bny\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 gu\u1e47\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 pratiprasava\u1e25 kaivalya\u1e41 svar\u016bpa-prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 v\u0101 citi-\u015baktir iti.\n\nThis citi-\u015bakti, or internal potency, is transcendental. Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha means material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This \u201coneness with the Supreme\u201d is called kaivalyam by the monist. But according to Pata\u00f1jali, this kaivalyam is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is called ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam, or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind. This \u201cclearance\u201d is actually liberation, or bhava-mah\u0101-d\u0101v\u0101gni-nirv\u0101pa\u1e47am. The theory of nirv\u0101\u1e47a \u2013 also preliminary \u2013 corresponds with this principle. In the Bh\u0101gavatam (2.10.6) this is called svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also confirms this situation in this verse.\n\nAfter nirv\u0101\u1e47a, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual activities, or devotional service to the Lord, known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In the words of the Bh\u0101gavatam, svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25: this is the \u201creal life of the living entity.\u201d M\u0101y\u0101, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Pata\u00f1jali also accepts this by his words kaivalya\u1e41 svar\u016bpa-prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 v\u0101 citi-\u015baktir iti. This citi-\u015bakti, or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (1.1.12) as \u0101nanda-mayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t. This natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by execution of devotional service, or bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga will be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\nIn the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of sam\u0101dhi, called sampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi and asampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi. When one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, he is said to have achieved sampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi. In the asampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the yog\u012b is once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the yog\u012b is able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today\u2019s so-called yoga practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A yog\u012b indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those yog\u012bs who are attracted by the siddhis (perfections) in the process of yoga are not perfectly situated. If yog\u012bs are attracted by the by-products of yoga, then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way.\n\nThe best practice of yoga in this age is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is not baffling. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing ha\u1e6dha-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, but there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga.\n\nAs long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure bhakti-yoga, or in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences \u2013 such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative \u2013 but he is always alert to execute his duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or bhakti-yoga. Accidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.14), \u0101gam\u0101p\u0101yino \u2019nity\u0101s t\u0101\u1e41s titik\u1e63asva bh\u0101rata. He endures all such incidental occurrences because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in yoga practice."}, {"verse": "TEXT 24", "devanagari": "\u0938 \u0928\u093f\u0936\u094d\u091a\u092f\u0947\u0928 \u092f\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0935\u094d\u092f\u094b \u092f\u094b\u0917\u094b\u093d\u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0923\u094d\u0923\u091a\u0947\u0924\u0938\u093e \u0964\n\u0938\u0919\u094d\u0915\u0932\u094d\u092a\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u0935\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0936\u0947\u0937\u0924: \u0964\n\u092e\u0928\u0938\u0948\u0935\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092f\u092e\u094d\u092f \u0938\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0924: \u0965 \u0968\u096a \u0965", "verse-text": "sa ni\u015bcayena yoktavyo\nyogo \u2019nirvi\u1e47\u1e47a-cetas\u0101\nsa\u1e45kalpa-prabhav\u0101n k\u0101m\u0101\u1e41s\ntyaktv\u0101 sarv\u0101n a\u015be\u1e63ata\u1e25\n\nmanasaivendriya-gr\u0101ma\u1e41\nviniyamya samantata\u1e25", "synonyms": "sa\u1e25 \u2014 that; ni\u015bcayena \u2014 with firm determination; yoktavya\u1e25 \u2014 must be practiced; yoga\u1e25 \u2014 yoga system; anirvi\u1e47\u1e47a-cetas\u0101 \u2014 without deviation; sa\u1e45kalpa \u2014 mental speculations; prabhav\u0101n \u2014 born of; k\u0101m\u0101n \u2014 material desires; tyaktv\u0101 \u2014 giving up; sarv\u0101n \u2014 all; a\u015be\u1e63ata\u1e25 \u2014 completely; manas\u0101 \u2014 by the mind; eva \u2014 certainly; indriya-gr\u0101mam \u2014 the full set of senses; viniyamya \u2014 regulating; samantata\u1e25 \u2014 from all sides.", "translation": "One should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with determination and faith and not be deviated from the path.

One should be sure of success at the end and pursue this course with great perseverance, not becoming discouraged if there is any delay in the attainment of success. Success is sure for the rigid practitioner. Regarding bhakti-yoga, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says:\n\n\u201cOne can execute the process of bhakti-yoga successfully with full-hearted enthusiasm, perseverance and determination, by following the prescribed duties in the association of devotees and by engaging completely in activities of goodness.\u201d (Upade\u015b\u0101m\u1e5bta 3)\n\nAs for determination, one should follow the example of the sparrow who lost her eggs in the waves of the ocean. A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow became very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not even consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She began to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her impossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last Garu\u1e0da, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, heard it. He became compassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow. Garu\u1e0da was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help.

The Lord in His Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature is situated within both the heart of the dog and that of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The perfect yog\u012b knows that the Lord is eternally transcendental and is not materially affected by His presence in either a dog or a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. That is the supreme neutrality of the Lord. The individual soul is also situated in the individual heart, but he is not present in all hearts. That is the distinction between the individual soul and the Supersoul. One who is not factually in the practice of yoga cannot see so clearly. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the heart of both the believer and the nonbeliever. In the sm\u1e5bti this is confirmed as follows: \u0101tatatv\u0101c ca m\u0101t\u1e5btv\u0101c ca \u0101tm\u0101 hi paramo hari\u1e25. The Lord, being the source of all beings, is like the mother and the maintainer. As the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children, the supreme father (or mother) is also. Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being.\n\nOutwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord. As will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has, primarily, two energies \u2013 the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior). The living entity, although part of the superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior energy; the living entity is always in the Lord\u2019s energy. Every living entity is situated in Him in one way or another.\n\nThe yog\u012b sees equally because he sees that all living entities, although in different situations according to the results of fruitive work, in all circumstances remain the servants of God. While in the material energy, the living entity serves the material senses; and while in the spiritual energy, he serves the Supreme Lord directly. In either case the living entity is the servant of God.

Such a person may appear to see all separate manifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is conscious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, knowing that everything is a manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy. Nothing can exist without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Lord of everything \u2013 this is the basic principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

At this stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, beyond self-realization, the devotee becomes one with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the sense that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes everything for the devotee and the devotee becomes full in loving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee then exists. In that stage, the living entity can never be annihilated, nor is the Personality of Godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is spiritual annihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38):\n\n\u201cI worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love.

He belonged to the royal family and was highly elevated in terms of numerous qualities; he was a great warrior, he had great longevity, and, above all, he was the most intimate friend of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Five thousand years ago, Arjuna had much better facilities than we do now, yet he refused to accept this system of yoga. In fact, we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any time. Therefore this system must be considered generally impossible in this Age of Kali.

But at the same time He suggests that by practice and detachment it is possible. What is that practice? In the present age no one can observe the strict rules and regulations of placing oneself in a sacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and mind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the Lord. The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all misgivings. The more one hears about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the more one becomes enlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learn vair\u0101gya. Vair\u0101gya means detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the mind to the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is practical because by hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit. This attachment is called pare\u015b\u0101nubhava, spiritual satisfaction. It is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats. The more one eats while hungry, the more one feels satisfaction and strength. Similarly, by discharge of devotional service one feels transcendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material objectives.

The basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in eternal life, bliss and knowledge. These are transcendental, beyond both body and mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, by the practice of the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga. In each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with God, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Following any of the above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out of these three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga is especially suitable for this age because it is the most direct method of God realization. To be doubly assured, Arjuna is asking Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to confirm His former statement. One may sincerely accept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge and the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult for this age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor one may fail, for many reasons. First of all, one may not be sufficiently serious about following the process. To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on the illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while performing transcendental disciplines. This is called yog\u0101c calita-m\u0101nasa\u1e25: deviation from the transcendental path.

On the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet not gain anything.\u201d For material prospects there are many activities, both scriptural and customary. A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One may argue that by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one may attain the highest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction for not executing prescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The Bh\u0101gavatam assures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even though he may be subjected to the reaction for not perfectly executing prescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nThe purport may be understood as follows. Humanity may be divided into two sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are engaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and noncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal propensities. Their activities are never auspicious, because while enjoying the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually remain in material existence, which is always miserable. On the other hand, those who are regulated by scriptural injunctions, and who thus rise gradually to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, certainly progress in life.\n\nThose who are following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into three sections, namely (1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who are enjoying material prosperity, (2) those who are trying to find ultimate liberation from material existence, and (3) those who are devotees in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the scriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those who are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification. Those who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to a higher standard of life \u2013 even to the higher planets \u2013 but still, because they are not free from material existence, they are not following the truly auspicious path. The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to liberation.

The English word \u201cworship\u201d cannot be used in the same sense as bhaj. Worship means to adore, or to show respect and honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he falls down. The Bh\u0101gavatam (11.5.3) confirms this as follows:\n\n\u201cAnyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the primeval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from his constitutional position.\u201d\n\nIn this verse also the word bhajanti is used. Therefore, bhajanti is applicable to the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word \u201cworship\u201d can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity. The word avaj\u0101nanti, used in this verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, is also found in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25: \u201cOnly the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 without an attitude of service to the Lord. Consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and the word \u201cworship.\u201d\n\nThe culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti yoga. All other yogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhakti-yoga. Yoga actually means bhakti-yoga; all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of bhakti-yoga. From the beginning of karma-yoga to the end of bhakti-yoga is a long way to self-realization. Karma-yoga, without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path. When karma-yoga increases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is called j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. When j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga increases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga. And when one surpasses the a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga and comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is called bhakti-yoga, the culmination. Factually, bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal, but to analyze bhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas. The yog\u012b who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name: karma-yog\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b or dhy\u0101na-yog\u012b, r\u0101ja-yog\u012b, ha\u1e6dha-yog\u012b, etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhakti-yoga, it is to be understood that he has surpassed all other yogas. Therefore, to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is the highest stage of yoga, just as, when we speak of Him\u0101layan, we refer to the world\u2019s highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.\n\nIt is by great fortune that one comes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness on the path of bhakti-yoga to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal yog\u012b concentrates his attention on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is called \u015ay\u0101masundara, who is as beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotuslike face is as effulgent as the sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels, and whose body is flower-garlanded. Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the brahma-jyotir. He incarnates in different forms such as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, and He is known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Govinda and V\u0101sudeva. He is the perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these features of the Lord, he is called the highest yog\u012b.\n\nThis stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti-yoga, as is confirmed in all Vedic literature:\n\n\u201cOnly unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.23)\n\nBhaktir asya bhajana\u1e41 tad ih\u0101mutrop\u0101dhi-nair\u0101syen\u0101mu\u1e63min mana\u1e25-kalpanam, etad eva nai\u1e63karmyam. \u201cBhakti means devotional service to the Lord which is free from desire for material profit, either in this life or in the next.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate people who become attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are described in this chapter.\n\nIn the first six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the living entity has been described as nonmaterial spirit soul capable of elevating himself to self-realization by different types of yogas. At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or in other words K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the highest form of all yoga. By concentrating one\u2019s mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is able to know the Absolute Truth completely, but not otherwise. Impersonal brahma-jyotir or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth, because it is partial. Full and scientific knowledge is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and everything is revealed to the person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one knows that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of yoga are only steppingstones on the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically knows about brahma-jyotir and Param\u0101tm\u0101 in full. By practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness yoga, one can know everything in full \u2013 namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia.\n\nOne should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the Supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which \u015brava\u1e47am is the first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, tac ch\u1e5b\u1e47u, or \u201cHear from Me.\u201d No one can be a greater authority than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity to become a perfectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person. One has therefore to learn from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly or from a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic education.\n\nIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam this process of understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows:\n\n\u201cTo hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly through the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is dwelling in everyone\u2019s heart, acts as a best-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the Bh\u0101gavatam and from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are wiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God perfectly. Thus bhakti-yoga severs the hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the stage of asa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e41 samagram, understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.17\u201321) Therefore only by hearing from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or from His devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can one understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}, {"verse": "TEXT 2", "devanagari": "\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u0924\u0947\u093d\u0939\u0902 \u0938\u0935\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u092e\u093f\u0926\u0902 \u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0936\u0947\u0937\u0924: \u0964\n\u092f\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e \u0928\u0947\u0939 \u092d\u0942\u092f\u094b\u093d\u0928\u094d\u092f\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0924\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092e\u0935\u0936\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0965 \u0968 \u0965", "verse-text": "j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 te \u2019ha\u1e41 sa-vij\u00f1\u0101nam\nida\u1e41 vak\u1e63y\u0101my a\u015be\u1e63ata\u1e25\nyaj j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 neha bh\u016byo \u2019nyaj\nj\u00f1\u0101tavyam ava\u015bi\u1e63yate", "synonyms": "j\u00f1\u0101nam \u2014 phenomenal knowledge; te \u2014 unto you; aham \u2014 I; sa \u2014 with; vij\u00f1\u0101nam \u2014 numinous knowledge; idam \u2014 this; vak\u1e63y\u0101mi \u2014 shall explain; a\u015be\u1e63ata\u1e25 \u2014 in full; yat \u2014 which; j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 \u2014 knowing; na \u2014 not; iha \u2014 in this world; bh\u016bya\u1e25 \u2014 further; anyat \u2014 anything more; j\u00f1\u0101tavyam \u2014 knowable; ava\u015bi\u1e63yate \u2014 remains.", "translation": "I shall now declare unto you in full this knowledge, both phenomenal and numinous.

Although the greatest of the impersonalists, \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, has admitted in his G\u012bt\u0101 commentary that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his followers do not accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as such, for it is very difficult to know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord Govinda. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25/ an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am. It is very difficult for the nondevotees to know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of bhakti, or devotional service, is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of bhakti is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult path? Actually the path of bhakti is not easy. The so-called path of bhakti practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti may be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b writes in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.101):\n\n\u201cDevotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upani\u1e63ads, Pur\u0101\u1e47as and N\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society.\u201d\n\nIt is not possible for the Brahman-realized impersonalist or the Param\u0101tm\u0101-realized yog\u012b to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (muhyanti yat s\u016braya\u1e25). M\u0101\u1e41 tu veda na ka\u015bcana: \u201cNo one knows Me as I am,\u201d the Lord says. And if one does know Him, then sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 su-durlabha\u1e25: \u201cSuch a great soul is very rare.\u201d Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, one cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is (tattvata\u1e25), even though one is a great scholar or philosopher. Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 His being the cause of all causes, His omnipotence and opulence, and His wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation \u2013 because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is benevolently inclined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said:\n\n\u201cNo one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is by the blunt material senses. But He reveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service unto Him.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.234)"}, {"verse": "TEXT 4", "devanagari": "\u092d\u0942\u092e\u093f\u0930\u093e\u092a\u094b\u093d\u0928\u0932\u094b \u0935\u093e\u092f\u0941: \u0916\u0902 \u092e\u0928\u094b \u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0930\u0947\u0935 \u091a \u0964\n\u0905\u0939\u0919\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0907\u0924\u0940\u092f\u0902 \u092e\u0947 \u092d\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0930\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0927\u093e \u0965 \u096a \u0965", "verse-text": "bh\u016bmir \u0101po \u2019nalo v\u0101yu\u1e25\nkha\u1e41 mano buddhir eva ca\naha\u1e45k\u0101ra it\u012bya\u1e41 me\nbhinn\u0101 prak\u1e5btir a\u1e63\u1e6dadh\u0101", "synonyms": "bh\u016bmi\u1e25 \u2014 earth; \u0101pa\u1e25 \u2014 water; anala\u1e25 \u2014 fire; v\u0101yu\u1e25 \u2014 air; kham \u2014 ether; mana\u1e25 \u2014 mind; buddhi\u1e25 \u2014 intelligence; eva \u2014 certainly; ca \u2014 and; aha\u1e45k\u0101ra\u1e25 \u2014 false ego; iti \u2014 thus; iyam \u2014 all these; me \u2014 My; bhinn\u0101 \u2014 separated; prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 \u2014 energies; a\u1e63\u1e6dadh\u0101 \u2014 eightfold.", "translation": "Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego \u2013 all together these eight constitute My separated material energies.", "purport": "The science of God analyzes the constitutional position of God and His diverse energies.

The first one, Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u, creates the total material energy, known as the mahat-tattva. The second, Garbhodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, enters into all the universes to create diversities in each of them. The third, K\u1e63\u012brodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as Param\u0101tm\u0101. He is present even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these three Vi\u1e63\u1e47us can be liberated from material entanglement.\u201d\n\nThis material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three Vi\u1e63\u1e47u expansions of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These puru\u1e63as are called incarnations. Generally one who does not know the science of God (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) assumes that this material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the puru\u1e63as \u2013 the causes, controllers and enjoyers of the material energy. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this atheistic conclusion is false. In the verse under discussion it is stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original cause of the material manifestation. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also confirms this. The ingredients of the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the brahma-jyotir, which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in the brahma-jyotir as there are in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-lokas, and the impersonalist accepts this brahma-jyotir as the ultimate eternal goal. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 manifestation is also a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the K\u1e63\u012brodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and internal energies.\n\nIn the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above mentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water, fire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations, within which the five sense objects are included. They are the manifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science comprises these ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely mind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists. Philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do not know the ultimate source, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The false ego \u2013 \u201cI am,\u201d and \u201cIt is mine,\u201d which constitute the basic principle of material existence \u2013 includes ten sense organs for material activities. Intelligence refers to the total material creation, called the mahat-tattva. Therefore from the eight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are the subject matter of S\u0101\u1e45khya atheistic philosophy; they are originally offshoots from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the cause of all causes. The subject matter for discussion in the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as it is described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101."}, {"verse": "TEXT 5", "devanagari": "\u0905\u092a\u0930\u0947\u092f\u092e\u093f\u0924\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f \u092e\u0947 \u092a\u0930\u093e\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u091c\u0940\u0935\u092d\u0942\u0924\u093e\u0902 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u092c\u093e\u0939\u094b \u092f\u092f\u0947\u0926\u0902 \u0927\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u091c\u0917\u0924\u094d \u0965 \u096b \u0965", "verse-text": "apareyam itas tv any\u0101\u1e41\nprak\u1e5bti\u1e41 viddhi me par\u0101m\nj\u012bva-bh\u016bt\u0101\u1e41 mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\nyayeda\u1e41 dh\u0101ryate jagat", "synonyms": "apar\u0101 \u2014 inferior; iyam \u2014 this; ita\u1e25 \u2014 besides this; tu \u2014 but; any\u0101m \u2014 another; prak\u1e5btim \u2014 energy; viddhi \u2014 just try to understand; me \u2014 My; par\u0101m \u2014 superior; j\u012bva-bh\u016bt\u0101m \u2014 comprising the living entities; mah\u0101-b\u0101ho \u2014 O mighty-armed one; yay\u0101 \u2014 by whom; idam \u2014 this; dh\u0101ryate \u2014 is utilized or exploited; jagat \u2014 the material world.", "translation": "Besides these, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature.", "purport": "Here it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior nature (or energy) of the Supreme Lord. The inferior energy is matter manifested in different elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. Both forms of material nature, namely gross (earth, etc.) and subtle (mind, etc.), are products of the inferior energy. The living entities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are the superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the entire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act unless it is moved by the superior energy, the living entity. Energies are always controlled by the energetic, and therefore the living entities are always controlled by the Lord \u2013 they have no independent existence. They are never equally powerful, as unintelligent men think. The distinction between the living entities and the Lord is described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.87.30) as follows:\n\n\u201cO Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and all-pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the living entities are accepted as minute energies of Your Lordship, then they are at once subject to Your supreme control. Therefore real liberation entails surrender by the living entities to Your control, and that surrender will make them happy. In that constitutional position only can they be controllers. Therefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that God and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually guided by a faulty and polluted opinion.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the only controller, and all living entities are controlled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and subtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets his real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the influence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes free from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage called mukti, or liberation. The false ego, under the influence of material illusion, thinks, \u201cI am matter, and material acquisitions are mine.\u201d His actual position is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the conception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may conclude that the G\u012bt\u0101 confirms the living entity to be only one of the multi-energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and when this energy is freed from material contamination, it becomes fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, or liberated."}, {"verse": "TEXT 6", "devanagari": "\u090f\u0924\u0926\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0928\u0940\u0928\u093f \u092d\u0942\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093f \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0923\u0940\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0941\u092a\u0927\u093e\u0930\u092f \u0964\n\u0905\u0939\u0902 \u0915\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0938\u094d\u0928\u0938\u094d\u092f \u091c\u0917\u0924: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u0935: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0932\u092f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0925\u093e \u0965 \u096c \u0965", "verse-text": "etad-yon\u012bni bh\u016bt\u0101ni\nsarv\u0101\u1e47\u012bty upadh\u0101raya\naha\u1e41 k\u1e5btsnasya jagata\u1e25\nprabhava\u1e25 pralayas tath\u0101", "synonyms": "etat \u2014 these two natures; yon\u012bni \u2014 whose source of birth; bh\u016bt\u0101ni \u2014 everything created; sarv\u0101\u1e47i \u2014 all; iti \u2014 thus; upadh\u0101raya \u2014 know; aham \u2014 I; k\u1e5btsnasya \u2014 all-inclusive; jagata\u1e25 \u2014 of the world; prabhava\u1e25 \u2014 the source of manifestation; pralaya\u1e25 \u2014 annihilation; tath\u0101 \u2014 as well as.", "translation": "All created beings have their source in these two natures.

In this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the affirmation of the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, Govinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version given in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.10): tato yad uttara-tara\u1e41 tad ar\u016bpam an\u0101mayam/ ya etad vidur am\u1e5bt\u0101s te bhavanti athetare du\u1e25kham ev\u0101piyanti. \u201cIn the material world Brahm\u0101, the primeval living entity within the universe, is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals. But beyond Brahm\u0101 there is the Transcendence, who has no material form and is free from all material contaminations. Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world.\u201d\n\nThe impersonalist puts more stress on the word ar\u016bpam. But this ar\u016bpam is not impersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and knowledge as described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 quoted above. Other verses in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.8\u20139) substantiate this as follows:\n\n\u201cI know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all material conceptions of darkness. Only he who knows Him can transcend the bonds of birth and death.

The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the sunshine, so the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by His all-pervading diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active principle of water. No one likes to drink sea water, because the pure taste of water is mixed with salt. Attraction for water depends on the purity of the taste, and this pure taste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist perceives the presence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist also glorifies the Lord for His kindly supplying tasty water to quench man\u2019s thirst. That is the way of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no conflict between personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in everything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore Lord Caitanya established His sublime doctrine: acintya bheda- and abheda-tattva \u2013 simultaneous oneness and difference.\n\nThe light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the brahma-jyotir, which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. And pra\u1e47ava, or the o\u1e41-k\u0101ra transcendental sound in the beginning of every Vedic hymn, addresses the Supreme Lord.

But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.", "purport": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all these energies are divine. Although the living entities are part of His energies and are therefore divine, due to contact with material energy their original superior power is covered. Being thus covered by material energy, one cannot possibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord, but due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called nitya-baddha, or eternally conditioned. No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of material nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an inferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior, material nature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic manifestation. The Vedas confirm this as follows: m\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 tu prak\u1e5bti\u1e41 vidy\u0101n m\u0101yina\u1e41 tu mahe\u015bvaram. \u201cAlthough m\u0101y\u0101 [illusion] is false or temporary, the background of m\u0101y\u0101 is the supreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Mahe\u015bvara, the supreme controller.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 4.10)\n\nAnother meaning of gu\u1e47a is rope; it is to be understood that the conditioned soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the hands and feet cannot free himself \u2013 he must be helped by a person who is unbound. Because the bound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be liberated. Therefore, only Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or His bona fide representative the spiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help, one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional service, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, can help one gain such release. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being the Lord of the illusory energy, can order this insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul. He orders this release out of His causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal affection for the living entity, who is originally a beloved son of the Lord. Therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get free from the clutches of the stringent material nature.\n\nThe words m\u0101m eva are also significant. M\u0101m means unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) only, and not Brahm\u0101 or \u015aiva. Although Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva are greatly elevated and are almost on the level of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, it is not possible for such incarnations of rajo-gu\u1e47a (passion) and tamo-gu\u1e47a (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. In other words, both Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva are also under the influence of m\u0101y\u0101. Only Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the master of m\u0101y\u0101; therefore He alone can give release to the conditioned soul. The Vedas (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 3.8) confirm this in the phrase tam eva viditv\u0101, or \u201cFreedom is possible only by understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Even Lord \u015aiva affirms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.

At this point a question arises: How is it that educated philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead? Mukti, or liberation from the laws of material nature, is sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and perseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is possible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then why don\u2019t these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this simple method?\n\nThe G\u012bt\u0101 answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders of society like Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva, Kapila, the Kum\u0101ras, Manu, Vy\u0101sa, Devala, Asita, Janaka, Prahl\u0101da, Bali, and later on Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya and many others \u2013 who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators, scientists, etc. \u2013 surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists, educators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as such for material gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea of God; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them. Because material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of \u201cplanning commissions.\u201d\n\nThe atheistic planmakers are described herein by the word du\u1e63k\u1e5btina\u1e25, or \u201cmiscreants.\u201d K\u1e5bt\u012b means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any gigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. But because the atheist\u2019s brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord, the atheistic planmaker is called du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012b, which indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected.\n\nIn the G\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independent authority. It works as the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But still material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the case of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu and R\u0101va\u1e47a, whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators. These du\u1e63k\u1e5btinas, or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as outlined below.\n\n(1) The m\u016b\u1e0dhas are those who are grossly foolish, like hardworking beasts of burden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do not want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast of burden is the ass. This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master. The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night. He remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying sound only disturbs others. This is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work. He does not know that karma (action) is meant for yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice).\n\nMost often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of self-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being. To such m\u016b\u1e0dhas, material gains, which are destructible, are life\u2019s all in all \u2013 despite the fact that the m\u016b\u1e0dhas enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with practically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for the benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish workers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never surrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of Him from the proper sources. The swine who eat the night soil do not care to accept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly continue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane world, but will have very little time to hear about the eternal living force that moves the material world.\n\n(2) Another class of du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012b, or miscreant, is called the nar\u0101dhama, or the lowest of mankind. Nara means human being, and adhama means the lowest. Out of the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000 human species. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are mostly uncivilized. The civilized human beings are those who have regulative principles of social, political and religious life. Those who are socially and politically developed but who have no religious principles must be considered nar\u0101dhamas. Nor is religion without God religion, because the purpose of following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and man\u2019s relation with Him. In the G\u012bt\u0101 the Personality of Godhead clearly states that there is no authority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The civilized form of human life is meant for man\u2019s reviving the lost consciousness of his eternal relation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is all-powerful. Whoever loses this chance is classified as a nar\u0101dhama. We get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mother\u2019s womb (an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for deliverance and promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To pray to God when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is eternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child forgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced by m\u0101y\u0101, the illusory energy.\n\nIt is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness dormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in the Manu-sm\u1e5bti, which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for reviving God consciousness in the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama. However, no process is strictly followed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of the population is nar\u0101dhama.\n\nWhen the whole population becomes nar\u0101dhama, naturally all their so-called education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of physical nature. According to the standard of the G\u012bt\u0101, a learned man is he who sees on equal terms the learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the dog, the cow, the elephant and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee. \u015ar\u012b Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical nar\u0101dhamas, the brothers Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the nar\u0101dhama who is condemned by the Personality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the mercy of a devotee.\n\n\u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, in propagating the bh\u0101gavata-dharma, or activities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of this message is Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The lowest amongst human beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunately they even refuse to give an aural reception to these messages, and what to speak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Nar\u0101dhamas, or the lowest of mankind, willfully neglect the prime duty of the human being.\n\n(3) The next class of du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012b is called m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25, or those persons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows \u2013 great philosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc. \u2013 but the illusory energy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.\n\nThere are a great number of m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 at the present moment, even amongst the scholars of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. In the G\u012bt\u0101, in plain and simple language, it is stated that \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned as the father of Brahm\u0101, the original father of all human beings. In fact, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is said to be not only the father of Brahm\u0101 but also the father of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, the m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 deride the personality of the Supreme Lord and consider Him merely another human being. They do not know that the blessed form of human life is designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the Supreme Lord.\n\nAll the unauthorized interpretations of the G\u012bt\u0101 by the class of m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25, outside the purview of the parampar\u0101 system, are so many stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding. The deluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nor do they teach others to follow this principle.\n\n(4) The last class of du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012b is called \u0101sura\u1e41 bh\u0101vam \u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25, or those of demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. There are others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the G\u012bt\u0101. Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such persons, whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead, cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n\u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya \u0100labandaru of South India said, \u201cO my Lord!

Out of these there are four classes of men \u2013 those who are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. These persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under different conditions. These are not pure devotees, because they have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit. The Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.1.11) defines pure devotion thus:\n\n\u201cOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.\u201d\n\nWhen these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult because their lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. But even some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees.\n\nThose who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in material distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simply frustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal Brahman and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and come to the personal conception of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On the whole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long as such a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendental service to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, the search for mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all this before one can come to the stage of pure devotional service."}, {"verse": "TEXT 17", "devanagari": "\u0924\u0947\u0937\u093e\u0902 \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0928\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924 \u090f\u0915\u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0936\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0964\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u094b \u0939\u093f \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0928\u094b\u093d\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0925\u092e\u0939\u0902 \u0938 \u091a \u092e\u092e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f: \u0965 \u0967\u096d \u0965", "verse-text": "te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b nitya-yukta\neka-bhaktir vi\u015bi\u1e63yate\npriyo hi j\u00f1\u0101nino \u2019tyartham\naha\u1e41 sa ca mama priya\u1e25", "synonyms": "te\u1e63\u0101m \u2014 out of them; j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b \u2014 one in full knowledge; nitya-yukta\u1e25 \u2014 always engaged; eka \u2014 only; bhakti\u1e25 \u2014 in devotional service; vi\u015bi\u1e63yate \u2014 is special; priya\u1e25 \u2014 very dear; hi \u2014 certainly; j\u00f1\u0101nina\u1e25 \u2014 to the person in knowledge; atyartham \u2014 highly; aham \u2014 I am; sa\u1e25 \u2014 he; ca \u2014 also; mama \u2014 to Me; priya\u1e25 \u2014 dear.", "translation": "Of these, the one who is in full knowledge and who is always engaged in pure devotional service is the best.

The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desires and do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of the Supreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there are recommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes (e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows that the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all.

As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all facilities so that they can fulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the all-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this material world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. The answer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give such facilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore He gives everyone full independence \u2013 whatever one likes \u2013 but His ultimate instruction we find in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: one should give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man happy.\n\nBoth the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to the demigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wanting some particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For example, a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a person wanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvat\u012b; and a person wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Um\u0101, the wife of Lord \u015aiva. In this way there are recommendations in the \u015b\u0101stras (Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of different demigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strong desire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and so he successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of the devotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type of demigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannot infuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts of all living entities, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods. The demigods are actually different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence.

Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he can attain that particular god\u2019s planet. It is not that everyone, regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to different planets in the material world but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly to the supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.\n\nHere the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent because they don\u2019t know to what part of the body food must be supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways to supply food. This isn\u2019t very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do not know that these demigods are different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each and every demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.\n\nNot only are the demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living entities are also.

Regardless of the situation, if one knows that both the demigods and he himself are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect.

This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.\n\nThe results achieved by the demigods\u2019 benedictions are perishable because within this material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable, and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent living entity. Because the pure devotee engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of the common worshiper of the demigods are different.

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His personal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form. Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession of R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, has written a very appropriate verse in this connection. He says,\n\n\u201cMy dear Lord, devotees like Vy\u0101sadeva and N\u0101rada know You to be the Personality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in discussing Ved\u0101nta and the Upani\u1e63ads and other Vedic literatures, it is not possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Stotra-ratna 12)\n\nIn the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be understood simply by study of the Ved\u0101nta literature. Only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only are the worshipers of the demigods less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Ved\u0101nta and speculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are also less intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God\u2019s personal nature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is impersonal are described as abuddhaya\u1e25, which means those who do not know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul \u2013 but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not even follow their great predecessor \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, who has specifically stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be only the son of Devak\u012b and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity. This is also condemned in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11). Avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam: \u201cOnly the fools regard Me as an ordinary person.\u201d\n\nThe fact is that no one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without rendering devotional service and without developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.29) confirms this:\n\n\u201cMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years.\u201d One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or His form, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, beginning by chanting the mah\u0101-mantra \u2013 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2013 then only can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has a body made of this material nature and that all His activities, His form and everything are m\u0101y\u0101. These impersonalists are known as M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs. They do not know the ultimate truth.\n\nThe twentieth verse clearly states, k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante \u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25: \u201cThose who are blinded by lusty desires surrender unto the different demigods.\u201d It is accepted that besides the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their different planets, and the Lord also has a planet. As stated in the twenty-third verse, dev\u0101n deva-yajo y\u0101nti mad-bhakt\u0101 y\u0101nti m\u0101m api: the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a go to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka planet. Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms are impositions. From the study of the G\u012bt\u0101 does it appear that the demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons; Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.\n\nTherefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is not imposed. From the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we can clearly understand that the forms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing and that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sac-cid-\u0101nanda, eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedic literature confirms that the Supreme Absolute Truth is knowledge and blissful pleasure, vij\u00f1\u0101nam \u0101nandam brahma (B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad 3.9.28), and that He is the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities, ananta-kaly\u0101na-gu\u1e47\u0101tmako \u2019sau (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a 6.5.84). And in the G\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that although He is aja (unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we should understand from the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. We cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of the impersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the G\u012bt\u0101 are concerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has both form and personality."}, {"verse": "TEXT 25", "devanagari": "\u0928\u093e\u0939\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936: \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092f\u094b\u0917\u092e\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0938\u092e\u093e\u0935\u0943\u0924: \u0964\n\u092e\u0942\u0922\u094b\u093d\u092f\u0902 \u0928\u093e\u092d\u093f\u091c\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0924\u093f \u0932\u094b\u0915\u094b \u092e\u093e\u092e\u091c\u092e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092f\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0968\u096b \u0965", "verse-text": "n\u0101ha\u1e41 prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 sarvasya\nyoga-m\u0101y\u0101-sam\u0101v\u1e5bta\u1e25\nm\u016b\u1e0dho \u2019ya\u1e41 n\u0101bhij\u0101n\u0101ti\nloko m\u0101m ajam avyayam", "synonyms": "na \u2014 nor; aham \u2014 I; prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 \u2014 manifest; sarvasya \u2014 to everyone; yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 \u2014 by internal potency; sam\u0101v\u1e5bta\u1e25 \u2014 covered; m\u016b\u1e0dha\u1e25 \u2014 foolish; ayam \u2014 these; na \u2014 not; abhij\u0101n\u0101ti \u2014 can understand; loka\u1e25 \u2014 persons; m\u0101m \u2014 Me; ajam \u2014 unborn; avyayam \u2014 inexhaustible.", "translation": "I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent.

If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were m\u0101y\u0101, material, as the impersonalists consider Him to be, then like the living entity He would change His body and forget everything about His past life. Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, nor can he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past, present and future. Unless one is liberated from material contamination, he cannot know past, present and future.\n\nUnlike the ordinary human being, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says that He completely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in the present, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter we have seen that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remembers instructing Vivasv\u0101n, the sun-god, millions of years ago. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows every living entity because He is situated in every living being\u2019s heart as the Supersoul.

Certainly the transcendental body of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not perishable. He is just like the sun, and m\u0101y\u0101 is like a cloud. In the material world we can see that there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars and planets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon and stars are not actually covered. Similarly, m\u0101y\u0101 cannot cover the Supreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the less intelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of this chapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to become perfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousands of such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is.

Naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\n\nThis Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person. The beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is association of persons who are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Such association is spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the same time one can really understand the constitutional position of the living entity and how the living entity forgets K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and becomes entangled in material activities. By gradual development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in good association, the living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.\n\nMany subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of Param\u0101tm\u0101, liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually elevated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not care for the different processes. He simply directly engages himself in activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional position as an eternal servitor of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotional service. He is convinced that by his doing so, all his objectives will be fulfilled.

But here Arjuna asks who is actually the Lord of yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice) and how the Lord is residing within the body of the living entity.\n\nArjuna addresses the Lord as Madhus\u016bdana because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once killed a demon named Madhu. Actually these questions, which are of the nature of doubts, should not have arisen in the mind of Arjuna, because Arjuna is a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotee. Therefore these doubts are like demons. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so expert in killing demons, Arjuna here addresses Him as Madhus\u016bdana so that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a might kill the demonic doubts that arise in Arjuna\u2019s mind.\n\nNow the word pray\u0101\u1e47a-k\u0101le in this verse is very significant because whatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna is very anxious to know of those who are constantly engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. What should be their position at that final moment? At the time of death all the bodily functions are disrupted, and the mind is not in a proper condition. Thus disturbed by the bodily situation, one may not be able to remember the Supreme Lord. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kula\u015bekhara, a great devotee, prays, \u201cMy dear Lord, just now I am quite healthy, and it is better that I die immediately so that the swan of my mind can seek entrance at the stem of Your lotus feet.\u201d The metaphor is used because the swan, a bird of the water, takes pleasure in digging into the lotus flowers; its sporting proclivity is to enter the lotus flower. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kula\u015bekhara says to the Lord, \u201cNow my mind is undisturbed, and I am quite healthy. If I die immediately, thinking of Your lotus feet, then I am sure that my performance of Your devotional service will become perfect. But if I have to wait for my natural death, then I do not know what will happen, because at that time the bodily functions will be disrupted, my throat will be choked up, and I do not know whether I shall be able to chant Your name.

But beyond Brahman there is Para-brahman. Brahman refers to the living entity, and Para-brahman refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The constitutional position of the living entity is different from the position he takes in the material world. In material consciousness his nature is to try to be the lord of matter, but in spiritual consciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his position is to serve the Supreme. When the living entity is in material consciousness, he has to take on various bodies in the material world. That is called karma, or varied creation by the force of material consciousness.\n\nIn Vedic literature the living entity is called j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 and Brahman, but he is never called Para-brahman. The living entity (j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101) takes different positions \u2013 sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies himself with matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior, spiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord\u2019s marginal energy. According to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a material or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of the 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In material nature he is manifested sometimes as a man, demigod, animal, beast, bird, etc., according to his karma. To attain material heavenly planets and enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (yaj\u00f1a), but when his merit is exhausted he returns to earth again in the form of a man. This process is called karma.\n\nThe Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad describes the Vedic sacrificial process. On the sacrificial altar, five kinds of offerings are made into five kinds of fire. The five kinds of fire are conceived of as the heavenly planets, clouds, the earth, man and woman, and the five kinds of sacrificial offerings are faith, the enjoyer on the moon, rain, grains and semen.\n\nIn the process of sacrifice, the living entity makes specific sacrifices to attain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the merit of sacrifice is exhausted, the living entity descends to earth in the form of rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and transformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living entity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material path. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices. He takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to Godhead.\n\nImpersonalist commentators on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 unreasonably assume that Brahman takes the form of j\u012bva in the material world, and to substantiate this they refer to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the G\u012bt\u0101. But in this verse the Lord also speaks of the living entity as \u201can eternal fragment of Myself.\u201d The fragment of God, the living entity, may fall down into the material world, but the Supreme Lord (Acyuta) never falls down. Therefore this assumption that the Supreme Brahman assumes the form of j\u012bva is not acceptable. It is important to remember that in Vedic literature Brahman (the living entity) is distinguished from Para-brahman (the Supreme Lord)."}, {"verse": "TEXT 4", "devanagari": "\u0905\u0927\u093f\u092d\u0942\u0924\u0902 \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u094b \u092d\u093e\u0935: \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u0936\u094d\u091a\u093e\u0927\u093f\u0926\u0948\u0935\u0924\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u0905\u0927\u093f\u092f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u094b\u093d\u0939\u092e\u0947\u0935\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0939\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0939\u092d\u0943\u0924\u093e\u0902 \u0935\u0930 \u0965 \u096a \u0965", "verse-text": "adhibh\u016bta\u1e41 k\u1e63aro bh\u0101va\u1e25\npuru\u1e63a\u015b c\u0101dhidaivatam\nadhiyaj\u00f1o \u2019ham ev\u0101tra\ndehe deha-bh\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e41 vara", "synonyms": "adhibh\u016btam \u2014 the physical manifestation; k\u1e63ara\u1e25 \u2014 constantly changing; bh\u0101va\u1e25 \u2014 nature; puru\u1e63a\u1e25 \u2014 the universal form, including all the demigods, like the sun and moon; ca \u2014 and; adhidaivatam \u2014 called adhidaiva; adhiyaj\u00f1a\u1e25 \u2014 the Supersoul; aham \u2014 I (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a); eva \u2014 certainly; atra \u2014 in this; dehe \u2014 body; deha-bh\u1e5bt\u0101m \u2014 of the embodied; vara \u2014 O best.", "translation": "O best of the embodied beings, the physical nature, which is constantly changing, is called adhibh\u016bta [the material manifestation].

This is a point we should note very carefully. How can one die in the proper state of mind?

Although as a deer he remembered his past activities, he had to accept that animal body. Of course, one\u2019s thoughts during the course of one\u2019s life accumulate to influence one\u2019s thoughts at the moment of death, so this life creates one\u2019s next life.

By this practice of chanting and hearing the sound vibration of the Supreme Lord, one\u2019s ear, tongue and mind are engaged. This mystic meditation is very easy to practice, and it helps one attain the Supreme Lord. Puru\u1e63am means enjoyer. Although living entities belong to the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord, they are in material contamination. They think themselves enjoyers, but they are not the supreme enjoyer.

The process of thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, the Lord is puru\u1e63a, a person \u2013 we think of the person R\u0101ma and the person K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And whether one thinks of R\u0101ma or of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, what He is like is described in this verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord is kavi; that is, He knows past, present and future and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest personality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born out of Him. He is also the supreme controller of the universe, and He is the maintainer and instructor of humanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is one ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small that He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller than the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the heart of the smallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still all-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary systems are sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air. It is stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is sustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya (\u201cinconceivable\u201d) is very significant in this connection. God\u2019s energy is beyond our conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable (acintya). Who can argue this point? He pervades this material world and yet is beyond it. We cannot comprehend even this material world, which is insignificant compared to the spiritual world \u2013 so how can we comprehend what is beyond? Acintya means that which is beyond this material world, that which our argument, logic and philosophical speculation cannot touch, that which is inconceivable. Therefore intelligent persons, avoiding useless argument and speculation, should accept what is stated in scriptures like the Vedas, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and follow the principles they set down.

Taking it for granted that Arjuna might not know how to practice \u1e63a\u1e6d-cakra-yoga, the Lord explains the process in the following verses. The Lord says that Brahman, although one without a second, has various manifestations and features. Especially for the impersonalists, the ak\u1e63ara, or o\u1e41-k\u0101ra \u2013 the syllable o\u1e41 \u2013 is identical with Brahman. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here explains the impersonal Brahman, into which the renounced order of sages enter.\n\nIn the Vedic system of knowledge, students, from the very beginning, are taught to vibrate o\u1e41 and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living with the spiritual master in complete celibacy. In this way they realize two of Brahman\u2019s features. This practice is very essential for the student\u2019s advancement in spiritual life, but at the moment such brahmac\u0101r\u012b (unmarried celibate) life is not at all possible. The social construction of the world has changed so much that there is no possibility of one\u2019s practicing celibacy from the beginning of student life. Throughout the world there are many institutions for different departments of knowledge, but there is no recognized institution where students can be educated in the brahmac\u0101r\u012b principles. Unless one practices celibacy, advancement in spiritual life is very difficult. Therefore Lord Caitanya has announced, according to the scriptural injunctions for this Age of Kali, that in this age no process of realizing the Supreme is possible except the chanting of the holy names of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare."}, {"verse": "TEXT 12", "devanagari": "\u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0938\u0902\u092f\u092e\u094d\u092f \u092e\u0928\u094b \u0939\u0943\u0926\u093f \u0928\u093f\u0930\u0941\u0927\u094d\u092f \u091a \u0964\n\u092e\u0942\u0927\u094d\u200d\u0928\u094d\u200d\u200d\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0927\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0928: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923\u092e\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u094b \u092f\u094b\u0917\u0927\u093e\u0930\u0923\u093e\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0967\u0968 \u0965", "verse-text": "sarva-dv\u0101r\u0101\u1e47i sa\u1e41yamya\nmano h\u1e5bdi nirudhya ca\nm\u016brdhny \u0101dh\u0101y\u0101tmana\u1e25 pr\u0101\u1e47am\n\u0101sthito yoga-dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101m", "synonyms": "sarva-dv\u0101r\u0101\u1e47i \u2014 all the doors of the body; sa\u1e41yamya \u2014 controlling; mana\u1e25 \u2014 the mind; h\u1e5bdi \u2014 in the heart; nirudhya \u2014 confining; ca \u2014 also; m\u016brdhni \u2014 on the head; \u0101dh\u0101ya \u2014 fixing; \u0101tmana\u1e25 \u2014 of the soul; pr\u0101\u1e47am \u2014 the life air; \u0101sthita\u1e25 \u2014 situated in; yoga-dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101m \u2014 the yogic situation.", "translation": "The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements.

Previous verses have mentioned four different kinds of devotees \u2013 the distressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, and the speculative philosophers. Different processes of liberation have also been described: karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and ha\u1e6dha-yoga. The principles of these yoga systems have some bhakti added, but this verse particularly mentions pure bhakti-yoga, without any mixture of j\u00f1\u0101na, karma or ha\u1e6dha. As indicated by the word ananya-cet\u0101\u1e25, in pure bhakti-yoga the devotee desires nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A pure devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek oneness with the brahma-jyotir or salvation or liberation from material entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta the pure devotee is called ni\u1e63k\u0101ma, which means he has no desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who strive for personal gain. Whereas a j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b, karma-yog\u012b or ha\u1e6dha-yog\u012b has his own selfish interests, a perfect devotee has no desire other than to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain.\n\nA pure devotee always engages in devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in one of His various personal features. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has various plenary expansions and incarnations, such as R\u0101ma and N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, and a devotee can choose to fix his mind in loving service to any of these transcendental forms of the Supreme Lord. Such a devotee meets with none of the problems that plague the practitioners of other yogas. Bhakti-yoga is very simple and pure and easy to perform. One can begin simply by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Lord is merciful to all, but as we have already explained, He is especially inclined toward those who always serve Him without deviation. The Lord helps such devotees in various ways. As stated in the Vedas (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 1.2.23), yam evai\u1e63a v\u1e5b\u1e47ute tena labhyas/ tasyai\u1e63a \u0101tm\u0101 viv\u1e5b\u1e47ute tanu\u1e41 sv\u0101m: one who is fully surrendered and engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord can understand the Supreme Lord as He is. And as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10), dad\u0101mi buddhi-yoga\u1e41 tam: the Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.\n\nThe special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation and without considering the time or place. There should be no impediments. He should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or some holy town where the Lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana by his devotional service. It was \u015ar\u012b Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, \u201cWherever You are, O Lord \u2013 there is V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\u201d\n\nAs indicated by the words satatam and nitya\u015ba\u1e25, which mean \u201calways,\u201d \u201cregularly,\u201d or \u201cevery day,\u201d a pure devotee constantly remembers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and meditates upon Him. These are qualifications of the pure devotee, for whom the Lord is most easily attainable. Bhakti-yoga is the system that the G\u012bt\u0101 recommends above all others. Generally, the bhakti-yog\u012bs are engaged in five different ways: (1) \u015b\u0101nta-bhakta, engaged in devotional service in neutrality; (2) d\u0101sya-bhakta, engaged in devotional service as servant; (3) sakhya-bhakta, engaged as friend; (4) v\u0101tsalya-bhakta, engaged as parent; and (5) m\u0101dhurya-bhakta, engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of these ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee cannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly the Supreme Lord cannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious process of chanting the mah\u0101-mantra \u2013 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare."}, {"verse": "TEXT 15", "devanagari": "\u092e\u093e\u092e\u0941\u092a\u0947\u0924\u094d\u092f \u092a\u0941\u0928\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e \u0926\u0941:\u0916\u093e\u0932\u092f\u092e\u0936\u093e\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0924\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u0928\u093e\u092a\u094d\u200d\u0928\u0941\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928: \u0938\u0902\u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0917\u0924\u093e: \u0965 \u0967\u096b \u0965", "verse-text": "m\u0101m upetya punar janma\ndu\u1e25kh\u0101layam a\u015b\u0101\u015bvatam\nn\u0101pnuvanti mah\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e25\nsa\u1e41siddhi\u1e41 param\u0101\u1e41 gat\u0101\u1e25", "synonyms": "m\u0101m \u2014 Me; upetya \u2014 achieving; puna\u1e25 \u2014 again; janma \u2014 birth; du\u1e25kha-\u0101layam \u2014 place of miseries; a\u015b\u0101\u015bvatam \u2014 temporary; na \u2014 never; \u0101pnuvanti \u2014 attain; mah\u0101-\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e25 \u2014 the great souls; sa\u1e41siddhim \u2014 perfection; param\u0101m \u2014 ultimate; gat\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 having achieved.", "translation": "After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yog\u012bs in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.", "purport": "Since this temporary material world is full of the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death, naturally he who achieves the highest perfection and attains the supreme planet, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, does not wish to return.

The mah\u0101tm\u0101s receive transcendental messages from the realized devotees and thus gradually develop devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and become so absorbed in transcendental service that they no longer desire elevation to any of the material planets, nor do they even want to be transferred to any spiritual planet.

All the variegatedness manifest there is of the quality of spiritual bliss \u2013 nothing there is material. That variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven. As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always in His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere \u2013 both in the material and in the spiritual universes. Yasy\u0101nta\u1e25-sth\u0101ni means that everything is sustained within Him, within either His spiritual or material energy.

No other process can help one attain that supreme abode. The Vedas (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.21) also describe the supreme abode and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Eko va\u015b\u012b sarva-ga\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25. In that abode there is only one Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the supreme merciful Deity, and although situated there as one He has expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. The Vedas compare the Lord to a tree standing still yet bearing many varieties of fruits, flowers and changing leaves. The plenary expansions of the Lord who preside over the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets are four-armed, and they are known by a variety of names \u2013 Puru\u1e63ottama, Trivikrama, Ke\u015bava, M\u0101dhava, Aniruddha, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna, \u015ar\u012bdhara, V\u0101sudeva, D\u0101modara, Jan\u0101rdana, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, V\u0101mana, Padman\u0101bha, etc.\n\nThe Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.37) also confirms that although the Lord is always in the supreme abode, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, He is all-pervading, so that everything is going on nicely (goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25).

One has to study the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only under the master\u2019s order, and if the master neglects to call the student for food that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for observing brahmacarya.\n\nAfter the student studies the Vedas under the master for some time \u2013 at least from age five to twenty \u2013 he becomes a man of perfect character. Study of the Vedas is not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of character. After this training, the brahmac\u0101r\u012b is allowed to enter into household life and marry. When he is a householder, he has to perform many sacrifices so that he may achieve further enlightenment. He must also give charity according to the country, time and candidate, discriminating among charity in goodness, in passion and in ignorance, as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of v\u0101naprastha, he undergoes severe penances \u2013 living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of brahmacarya, householder life, v\u0101naprastha and finally sanny\u0101sa, one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahma-jyotir or in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures.\n\nThe beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all the rituals of the different orders of life.\n\nThe words ida\u1e41 viditv\u0101 indicate that one should understand the instructions given by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this chapter and the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One should try to understand these chapters not by scholarship or mental speculation but by hearing them in association with devotees. Chapters Seven through Twelve are the essence of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The first six and the last six chapters are like coverings for the middle six chapters, which are especially protected by the Lord. If one is fortunate enough to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 \u2013 especially these middle six chapters \u2013 in the association of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc., for one can achieve all the results of these activities simply by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nOne who has a little faith in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should learn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from a devotee, because in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated clearly that Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 can be understood only by devotees; no one else can perfectly understand the purpose of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One should therefore learn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not from mental speculators. This is a sign of faith. When one searches for a devotee and fortunately gets a devotee\u2019s association one actually begins to study and understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. By advancement in the association of the devotee one is placed in devotional service, and this service dispels all one\u2019s misgivings about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities, form, pastimes, name and other features. After these misgivings have been perfectly cleared away, one becomes fixed in one\u2019s study. Then one relishes the study of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and attains the state of feeling always K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This highest perfectional stage of life enables the devotee to be transferred to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where the devotee becomes eternally happy."}], "desc": ""}, {"name": "Chapter Nine: The Most Confidential Knowledge", "link": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/9/advanced-view", "verses": [{"verse": "TEXT 1", "devanagari": "\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0935\u093e\u091a\n\u0907\u0926\u0902 \u0924\u0941 \u0924\u0947 \u0917\u0941\u0939\u094d\u092f\u0924\u092e\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0928\u0938\u0942\u092f\u0935\u0947 \u0964\n\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0938\u0939\u093f\u0924\u0902 \u092f\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e \u092e\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0938\u0947\u093d\u0936\u200d\u0941\u092d\u093e\u0924\u094d \u0965 \u0967 \u0965", "verse-text": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\nida\u1e41 tu te guhya-tama\u1e41\npravak\u1e63y\u0101my anas\u016byave\nj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 vij\u00f1\u0101na-sahita\u1e41\nyaj j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 mok\u1e63yase \u2019\u015bubh\u0101t", "synonyms": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca \u2014 the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; idam \u2014 this; tu \u2014 but; te \u2014 unto you; guhya-tamam \u2014 the most confidential; pravak\u1e63y\u0101mi \u2014 I am speaking; anas\u016byave \u2014 to the nonenvious; j\u00f1\u0101nam \u2014 knowledge; vij\u00f1\u0101na \u2014 realized knowledge; sahitam \u2014 with; yat \u2014 which; j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 \u2014 knowing; mok\u1e63yase \u2014 you will be released; a\u015bubh\u0101t \u2014 from this miserable material existence.", "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, because you are never envious of Me, I shall impart to you this most confidential knowledge and realization, knowing which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence.", "purport": "As a devotee hears more and more about the Supreme Lord, he becomes enlightened. This hearing process is recommended in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: \u201cThe messages of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are full of potencies, and these potencies can be realized if topics regarding the Supreme Godhead are discussed amongst devotees.\u201d This cannot be achieved by the association of mental speculators or academic scholars, for it is realized knowledge.\n\nThe devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord\u2019s service. The Lord understands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity who is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and gives him the intelligence to understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the association of devotees. Discussion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very potent, and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to assimilate the knowledge, then he will surely make advancement toward spiritual realization. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and higher elevation in His potent service, describes in this Ninth Chapter matters more confidential than any He has already disclosed.\n\nThe very beginning of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the First Chapter, is more or less an introduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third chapters, the spiritual knowledge described is called confidential. Topics discussed in the Seventh and Eighth chapters are specifically related to devotional service, and because they bring enlightenment in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, they are called more confidential. But the matters which are described in the Ninth Chapter deal with unalloyed, pure devotion. Therefore this is called the most confidential. One who is situated in the most confidential knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is naturally transcendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is in the material world. In the Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu it is said that although one who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is situated in the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered liberated. Similarly, we shall find in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Tenth Chapter, that anyone who is engaged in that way is a liberated person.\n\nNow this first verse has specific significance. The words ida\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101nam (\u201cthis knowledge\u201d) refer to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different activities: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying, maintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice of these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. When one\u2019s heart is thus cleared of material contamination, one can understand this science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Simply to understand that a living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may be the beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference between activities of the body and the spiritual activities of one who understands that he is not the body.\n\nIn the Seventh Chapter we have already discussed the opulent potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His different energies, the inferior and superior natures, and all this material manifestation. Now in Chapter Nine the glories of the Lord will be delineated.\n\nThe Sanskrit word anas\u016byave in this verse is also very significant. Generally the commentators, even if they are highly scholarly, are all envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most erudite scholars write on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 very inaccurately. Because they are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, their commentaries are useless. The commentaries given by devotees of the Lord are bona fide. No one can explain Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or give perfect knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a if he is envious. One who criticizes the character of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without knowing Him is a fool. So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided. For one who understands that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the pure and transcendental Personality, these chapters will be very beneficial."}, {"verse": "TEXT 2", "devanagari": "\u0930\u093e\u091c\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0917\u0941\u0939\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u092a\u0935\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093f\u0926\u092e\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0935\u0917\u092e\u0902 \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u0938\u0941\u0938\u0941\u0916\u0902 \u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0941\u092e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092f\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0968 \u0965", "verse-text": "r\u0101ja-vidy\u0101 r\u0101ja-guhya\u1e41\npavitram idam uttamam\npratyak\u1e63\u0101vagama\u1e41 dharmya\u1e41\nsu-sukha\u1e41 kartum avyayam", "synonyms": "r\u0101ja-vidy\u0101 \u2014 the king of education; r\u0101ja-guhyam \u2014 the king of confidential knowledge; pavitram \u2014 the purest; idam \u2014 this; uttamam \u2014 transcendental; pratyak\u1e63a \u2014 by direct experience; avagamam \u2014 understood; dharmyam \u2014 the principle of religion; su-sukham \u2014 very happy; kartum \u2014 to execute; avyayam \u2014 everlasting.", "translation": "This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.", "purport": "This chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is called the king of education because it is the essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before. Among the principal philosophers in India are Gautama, Ka\u1e47\u0101da, Kapila, Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya, \u015a\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dilya and Vai\u015bv\u0101nara. And finally there is Vy\u0101sadeva, the author of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. So there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or transcendental knowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the king of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of the Vedas and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most confidential because confidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference between the soul and the body. And the king of all confidential knowledge culminates in devotional service.\n\nGenerally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are educated in external knowledge. As far as ordinary education is concerned, people are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc. There are so many departments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but there is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution where the science of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important part of the body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value. Still people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for the vital soul.\n\nThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the importance of the soul. In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is perishable and that the soul is not perishable (antavanta ime deh\u0101 nityasyokt\u0101\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bri\u1e47a\u1e25). That is a confidential part of knowledge: simply knowing that the spirit soul is different from this body and that its nature is immutable, indestructible and eternal. But that gives no positive information about the soul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from the body and that when the body is finished, or one is liberated from the body, the soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal. But actually that is not the fact. How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always active. If it is eternal, then it is eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most confidential part of all knowledge.\n\nThis knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as explained in Vedic literature. In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, man\u2019s sinful activities have been analyzed and are shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive activities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For instance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear immediately to grow; it takes some time. It is first a small, sprouting plant, then it assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers and bears fruit, and, when it is complete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the seed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes time to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action may have already stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that sinful action are still to be enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of a seed, and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit, which we are enjoying as distress and pain.\n\nAs explained in the twenty-eighth verse of the Seventh Chapter, a person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this material world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words, those who are actually engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed from all reactions. This statement is confirmed in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a:\n\nFor those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all sinful reactions, whether fructified, in the stock, or in the form of a seed, gradually vanish. Therefore the purifying potency of devotional service is very strong, and it is called pavitram uttamam, the purest. Uttama means transcendental. Tamas means this material world or darkness, and uttama means that which is transcendental to material activities. Devotional activities are never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see and is familiar with devotional service will know that they are not material activities. They are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the material modes of nature.\n\nIt is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can perceive the results directly. This direct result is actually perceived, and we have practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare) in course of chanting without offenses feels some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material contamination. This is actually seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well, or if he engages himself in helping the missionary activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he gradually feels spiritual progress. This advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any kind of previous education or qualification. The method itself is so pure that by simply engaging in it one becomes pure.\n\nIn the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (3.2.26) this is also described in the following words: prak\u0101\u015ba\u015b ca karma\u1e47y abhy\u0101s\u0101t. \u201cDevotional service is so potent that simply by engaging in the activities of devotional service one becomes enlightened without a doubt.\u201d A practical example of this can be seen in the previous life of N\u0101rada, who in that life happened to be the son of a maidservant. He had no education, nor was he born into a high family. But when his mother was engaged in serving great devotees, N\u0101rada also became engaged, and sometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees himself. N\u0101rada personally says,\n\nIn this verse from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.25) N\u0101rada describes his previous life to his disciple Vy\u0101sadeva. He says that while engaged as a boy servant for those purified devotees during the four months of their stay, he was intimately associating with them. Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash their dishes, wanted to taste the remnants. So he asked the great devotees for their permission, and when they gave it N\u0101rada ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions. As he went on eating, he gradually became as pure-hearted as the sages. The great devotees relished the taste of unceasing devotional service to the Lord by hearing and chanting, and N\u0101rada gradually developed the same taste. N\u0101rada says further,\n\nBy associating with the sages, N\u0101rada got the taste for hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, and he developed a great desire for devotional service. Therefore, as described in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, prak\u0101\u015ba\u015b ca karma\u1e47y abhy\u0101s\u0101t: if one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service, everything is revealed to him automatically, and he can understand. This is called pratyak\u1e63a, directly perceived.\n\nThe word dharmyam means \u201cthe path of religion.\u201d N\u0101rada was actually a son of a maidservant. He had no opportunity to go to school. He was simply assisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the devotees. The child N\u0101rada also got the opportunity and simply by association achieved the highest goal of all religion. The highest goal of all religion is devotional service, as stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (sa vai pu\u1e41s\u0101\u1e41 paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhok\u1e63aje). Religious people generally do not know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of devotional service. As we have already discussed in regard to the last verse of Chapter Eight (vede\u1e63u yaj\u00f1e\u1e63u tapa\u1e25su caiva), generally Vedic knowledge is required for self-realization. But here, although N\u0101rada never went to the school of the spiritual master and was not educated in the Vedic principles, he acquired the highest results of Vedic study. This process is so potent that even without performing the religious process regularly, one can be raised to the highest perfection. How is this possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature: \u0101c\u0101ryav\u0101n puru\u1e63o veda. One who is in association with great \u0101c\u0101ryas, even if he is not educated or has never studied the Vedas, can become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for realization.\n\nThe process of devotional service is a very happy one (su-sukham). Why? Devotional service consists of \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25, so one can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized \u0101c\u0101ryas. Simply by sitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In every state devotional service is joyful. One can execute devotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition. The Lord says, patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toyam: He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, can be offered by any person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if offered with love. There are many instances in history. Simply by tasting the tulas\u012b leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanat-kum\u0101ra became great devotees. Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. God accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him.\n\nIt is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers claim. Although they sometimes take to so-called devotional service, their idea is that as long as they are not liberated they will continue their devotional service, but at the end, when they become liberated, they will \u201cbecome one with God.\u201d Such temporary time-serving devotional service is not accepted as pure devotional service. Actual devotional service continues even after liberation. When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord. He does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord.\n\nAs will be seen in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, actual devotional service begins after liberation. After one is liberated, when one is situated in the Brahman position (brahma-bh\u016bta), one\u2019s devotional service begins (sama\u1e25 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u mad-bhakti\u1e41 labhate par\u0101m). No one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga or any other yoga independently. By these yogic methods one may make a little progress toward bhakti-yoga, but without coming to the stage of devotional service one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by executing the process of devotional service, especially by hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam or Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from realized souls, then he can understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the science of God. Eva\u1e41 prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogata\u1e25. When one\u2019s heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one can understand what God is. Thus the process of devotional service, of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all confidential knowledge. It is the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully without difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it."}, {"verse": "TEXT 3", "devanagari": "\u0905\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0926\u094d\u0926\u0927\u093e\u0928\u093e: \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u093e \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092a\u0930\u0928\u094d\u0924\u092a \u0964\n\u0905\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092a\u094d\u092f \u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0928\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u092e\u0943\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0938\u0902\u0938\u093e\u0930\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093f \u0965 \u0969 \u0965", "verse-text": "a\u015braddadh\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 puru\u1e63\u0101\ndharmasy\u0101sya paran-tapa\napr\u0101pya m\u0101\u1e41 nivartante\nm\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-vartmani", "synonyms": "a\u015braddadh\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 those who are faithless; puru\u1e63\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 such persons; dharmasya \u2014 toward the process of religion; asya \u2014 this; param-tapa \u2014 O killer of the enemies; apr\u0101pya \u2014 without obtaining; m\u0101m \u2014 Me; nivartante \u2014 come back; m\u1e5btyu \u2014 of death; sa\u1e41s\u0101ra \u2014 in material existence; vartmani \u2014 on the path.", "translation": "Those who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of enemies. Therefore they return to the path of birth and death in this material world.", "purport": "The faithless cannot accomplish this process of devotional service; that is the purport of this verse. Faith is created by association with devotees. Unfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature from great personalities, still have no faith in God. They are hesitant and cannot stay fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. Thus faith is a most important factor for progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that faith is the complete conviction that simply by serving the Supreme Lord, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can achieve all perfection. That is called real faith. As stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (4.31.14),\n\n\u201cBy giving water to the root of a tree one satisfies its branches, twigs and leaves, and by supplying food to the stomach one satisfies all the senses of the body. Similarly, by engaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord one automatically satisfies all the demigods and all other living entities.\u201d Therefore, after reading Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 one should promptly come to the conclusion of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: one should give up all other engagements and adopt the service of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead. If one is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith.\n\nNow, the development of that faith is the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. There are three divisions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious men. In the third class are those who have no faith. Even if they are officially engaged in devotional service, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage. Most probably they will slip, after some time. They may become engaged, but because they haven\u2019t complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to continue in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. We have practical experience in discharging our missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a little well situated they give up this process and take to their old ways again. It is only by faith that one can advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As far as the development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of devotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is called a first-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And in the second class are those who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who automatically have firm faith that k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-bhakti, or service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the best course and so in good faith have taken it up. Thus they are superior to the third class, who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second class he does not fall down, and for the first-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness there is no chance of falling down. One in the first class will surely make progress and achieve the result at the end. As far as the third-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction that devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very good, he has not yet gained adequate knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through the scriptures like \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Sometimes these third-class persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness have some tendency toward karma-yoga and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, and sometimes they are disturbed, but as soon as the infection of karma-yoga or j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga is vanquished, they become second-class or first-class persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also divided into three stages and described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. First-class attachment, second-class attachment and third-class attachment are also explained in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam in the Eleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the excellence of devotional service, who think that it is simply eulogy, find the path very difficult, even if they are supposedly engaged in devotional service. For them there is very little hope of gaining perfection. Thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service."}, {"verse": "TEXT 4", "devanagari": "\u092e\u092f\u093e \u0924\u0924\u092e\u093f\u0926\u0902 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u091c\u0917\u0926\u0935\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0924\u092e\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0928\u093e \u0964\n\u092e\u0924\u094d\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928\u093f \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u092d\u0942\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093f \u0928 \u091a\u093e\u0939\u0902 \u0924\u0947\u0937\u094d\u0935\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924: \u0965 \u096a \u0965", "verse-text": "may\u0101 tatam ida\u1e41 sarva\u1e41\njagad avyakta-m\u016brtin\u0101\nmat-sth\u0101ni sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni\nna c\u0101ha\u1e41 te\u1e63v avasthita\u1e25", "synonyms": "may\u0101 \u2014 by Me; tatam \u2014 pervaded; idam \u2014 this; sarvam \u2014 all; jagat \u2014 cosmic manifestation; avyakta-m\u016brtin\u0101 \u2014 by the unmanifested form; mat-sth\u0101ni \u2014 in Me; sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni \u2014 all living entities; na \u2014 not; ca \u2014 also; aham \u2014 I; te\u1e63u \u2014 in them; avasthita\u1e25 \u2014 situated.", "translation": "By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded.

Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under proper guidance is He revealed. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38) it is stated, prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa\u1e25 sadaiva h\u1e5bdaye\u1e63u vilokayanti: one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, always within himself and outside himself if one has developed the transcendental loving attitude towards Him. Thus for people in general He is not visible. Here it is said that although He is all-pervading, everywhere present, He is not conceivable by the material senses. This is indicated here by the word avyakta-m\u016brtin\u0101. But actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As we have discussed in the Seventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination of His two different energies \u2013 the superior, spiritual energy and the inferior, material energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in that energy.\n\nYet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His personal existence. To refute such an argument the Lord says, \u201cI am everywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof.\u201d For example, a king heads a government which is but the manifestation of the king\u2019s energy; the different governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king, and each department is resting on the king\u2019s power. But still one cannot expect the king to be present in every department personally. That is a crude example. Similarly, all the manifestations that we see and everything that exists, both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Such an image should not be entertained in connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s upholding this created universe. He says that although everything is resting on Him, He is aloof.

But when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants to do something, simply by His willing, everything is performed so perfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being done. The Lord explains this fact: although He is the maintainer and sustainer of the entire material manifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation. Simply by His supreme will, everything is created, everything is sustained, everything is maintained and everything is annihilated. There is no difference between His mind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our present material mind) because He is absolute spirit.

But although the wind is great, it is still situated within the sky; the wind is not beyond the sky. Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will. As we generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are many foolish men who consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be merely a powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25); He is the Supreme Lord.\n\nThere are many \u012b\u015bvaras, controllers, and one appears greater than another. In the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some official or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and above him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is controlled by another. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is said that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly, both in the material and spiritual world, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme controller (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25), and His body is sac-cid-\u0101nanda, nonmaterial.\n\nMaterial bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a common man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body is called here m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012bm because He is acting just like a man, a friend of Arjuna\u2019s, a politician involved in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. In so many ways He is acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha \u2013 eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is confirmed in the Vedic language also. Sac-cid-\u0101nanda-r\u016bp\u0101ya k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101ya: \u201cI offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the eternal blissful form of knowledge.\u201d (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.1) There are other descriptions in the Vedic language also. Tam eka\u1e41 govindam: \u201cYou are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows.\u201d Sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraham: \u201cAnd Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality.\u201d (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.38)\n\nDespite the transcendental qualities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body, its full bliss and knowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary man. The scholar may be born an extraordinary man due to his previous good work, but this conception of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is due to a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called m\u016b\u1e0dha, for only foolish persons consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary human being. The foolish consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a an ordinary human being because they do not know the confidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies. They do not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He is the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award liberation to anyone. Because they do not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has so many transcendental qualifications, they deride Him.\n\nNor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. He is the master of the material energy. As has been explained in several places (mama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101), He claims that the material energy, although very powerful, is under His control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out of the control of this material energy. If a soul surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can get out of the influence of material energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature, have a material body like us? So this conception of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is complete foolishness. Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic manifestation of the universal form. The biggest and the minutest are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute. Actually, although He is controlling the infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning His yogam ai\u015bvaram, His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the infinite and the finite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them. Although the foolish cannot imagine how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who appears just like a human being, can control the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this, for they know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore they completely surrender unto Him and engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.\n\nThere are many controversies between the impersonalists and the personalists about the Lord\u2019s appearance as a human being. But if we consult Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the authoritative texts for understanding the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then we can understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is not an ordinary man, although He appeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages headed by \u015aaunaka inquired about the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they said:\n\n\u201cLord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with Balar\u0101ma, played like a human being, and so masked He performed many superhuman acts.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.1.20) The Lord\u2019s appearance as a man bewilders the foolish. No human being could perform the wonderful acts that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a performed while He was present on this earth. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared before His father and mother, Vasudeva and Devak\u012b, He appeared with four hands, but after the prayers of the parents He transformed Himself into an ordinary child. As stated in the Bh\u0101gavatam (10.3.46), babh\u016bva pr\u0101k\u1e5bta\u1e25 \u015bi\u015bu\u1e25: He became just like an ordinary child, an ordinary human being. Now, here again it is indicated that the Lord\u2019s appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His transcendental body. In the Eleventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also it is stated that Arjuna prayed to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s form of four hands (tenaiva r\u016bpe\u1e47a catur-bhujena). After revealing this form, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, when petitioned by Arjuna, again assumed His original humanlike form (m\u0101nu\u1e63a\u1e41 r\u016bpam). These different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an ordinary human being.\n\nSome of those who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who are infected with the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy quote the following verse from the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.29.21) to prove that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is just an ordinary man. Aha\u1e41 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u bh\u016bt\u0101tm\u0101vasthita\u1e25 sad\u0101: \u201cThe Supreme is present in every living entity.\u201d We should better take note of this particular verse from the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas like J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, commenting on this verse, says that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in His plenary expansion as Param\u0101tm\u0101, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the arc\u0101-m\u016brti, the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple. There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the lowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the temple than to other devotees, so Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura warns that this sort of mentality should be corrected. A devotee should see that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present in everyone\u2019s heart as Param\u0101tm\u0101, every body is the embodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord; so as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and every body in which the Param\u0101tm\u0101 dwells. Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected.\n\nThere are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say that since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the personalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually, a perfect devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness knows that although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality, He is all-pervading, as confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Although His personal abode is Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and He is always staying there, by His different manifestations of energy and by His plenary expansion He is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation."}, {"verse": "TEXT 12", "devanagari": "\u092e\u094b\u0918\u093e\u0936\u093e \u092e\u094b\u0918\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923\u094b \u092e\u094b\u0918\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0935\u093f\u091a\u0947\u0924\u0938: \u0964\n\u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0938\u0940\u092e\u093e\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0940\u0902 \u091a\u0948\u0935 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0902 \u092e\u094b\u0939\u093f\u0928\u0940\u0902 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924\u093e: \u0965 \u0967\u0968 \u0965", "verse-text": "mogh\u0101\u015b\u0101 mogha-karm\u0101\u1e47o\nmogha-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101 vicetasa\u1e25\nr\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bm \u0101sur\u012b\u1e41 caiva\nprak\u1e5bti\u1e41 mohin\u012b\u1e41 \u015brit\u0101\u1e25", "synonyms": "mogha-\u0101\u015b\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 baffled in their hopes; mogha-karm\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25 \u2014 baffled in fruitive activities; mogha-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 baffled in knowledge; vicetasa\u1e25 \u2014 bewildered; r\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bm \u2014 demonic; \u0101sur\u012bm \u2014 atheistic; ca \u2014 and; eva \u2014 certainly; prak\u1e5btim \u2014 nature; mohin\u012bm \u2014 bewildering; \u015brit\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 taking shelter of.", "translation": "Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views.

In other words, persons who mock K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic. As described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, such demonic miscreants never surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

The first sign of the mah\u0101tm\u0101 is that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not under the control of material nature. And how is this effected? That is explained in the Seventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, at once becomes freed from the control of material nature. That is the qualification. One can become free from the control of material nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the preliminary formula. Being marginal potency, as soon as the living entity is freed from the control of material nature, he is put under the guidance of the spiritual nature. The guidance of the spiritual nature is called daiv\u012b prak\u1e5bti, divine nature.

The Lord tells Arjuna that those who are purely in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and do not know anything other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are called mah\u0101tm\u0101; yet there are other persons who are not exactly in the position of mah\u0101tm\u0101 but who worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also, in different ways. Some of them have already been described as the distressed, the financially destitute, the inquisitive, and those who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. But there are others who are still lower, and these are divided into three: (1) he who worships himself as one with the Supreme Lord, (2) he who concocts some form of the Supreme Lord and worships that, and (3) he who accepts the universal form, the vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worships that. Out of the above three, the lowest, those who worship themselves as the Supreme Lord, thinking themselves to be monists, are most predominant. Such people think themselves to be the Supreme Lord, and in this mentality they worship themselves. This is also a type of God worship, for they can understand that they are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul; at least, such a sense is prominent. Generally the impersonalists worship the Supreme Lord in this way. The second class includes the worshipers of the demigods, those who by imagination consider any form to be the form of the Supreme Lord.

By such endeavor, the worshipers of different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the lower qualities of nature and are thereby elevated to the higher planetary systems or heavenly planets known as Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, etc. Once situated on those higher planetary systems, one can satisfy his senses hundreds of thousands of times better than on this planet."}, {"verse": "TEXT 21", "devanagari": "\u0924\u0947 \u0924\u0902 \u092d\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0932\u094b\u0915\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u093e\u0932\u0902\n\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0940\u0923\u0947 \u092a\u0941\u0923\u094d\u092f\u0947 \u092e\u0930\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0932\u094b\u0915\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0964\n\u090f\u0935\u0902 \u0924\u094d\u0930\u092f\u0940\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u092e\u0928\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092a\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e\n\u0917\u0924\u093e\u0917\u0924\u0902 \u0915\u093e\u092e\u0915\u093e\u092e\u093e \u0932\u092d\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0965 \u0968\u0967 \u0965", "verse-text": "te ta\u1e41 bhuktv\u0101 svarga-loka\u1e41 vi\u015b\u0101la\u1e41\nk\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martya-loka\u1e41 vi\u015banti\neva\u1e41 tray\u012b-dharmam anuprapann\u0101\ngat\u0101gata\u1e41 k\u0101ma-k\u0101m\u0101 labhante", "synonyms": "te \u2014 they; tam \u2014 that; bhuktv\u0101 \u2014 having enjoyed; svarga-lokam \u2014 heaven; vi\u015b\u0101lam \u2014 vast; k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e \u2014 being exhausted; pu\u1e47ye \u2014 the results of their pious activities; martya-lokam \u2014 to the mortal earth; vi\u015banti \u2014 fall down; evam \u2014 thus; tray\u012b \u2014 of the three Vedas; dharmam \u2014 doctrines; anuprapann\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 following; gata-\u0101gatam \u2014 death and birth; k\u0101ma-k\u0101m\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 desiring sense enjoyments; labhante \u2014 attain.", "translation": "When they have thus enjoyed vast heavenly sense pleasure and the results of their pious activities are exhausted, they return to this mortal planet again.

If one wishes to engage in devotional service to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of life \u2013 the transcendental loving service of God \u2013 then one should find out what the Lord desires of him. One who loves K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will give Him whatever He wants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked. Thus meat, fish and eggs should not be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If He desired such things as offerings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flowers and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, \u201cI will accept it.\u201d Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and eggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not accept it. Thus we cannot be acting on the level of loving devotion if we offer such foods.\n\nIn the Third Chapter, verse 13, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains that only the remains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement. Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature. But preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or Deity of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble offering enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the offering should be made with an attitude of love. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has no need of food, since He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering of one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in preparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nThe impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. To them, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the speaker of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. But, in actuality, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can perform the function of any other. This is what it means to say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is absolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all opulences. In the Seventh Chapter, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has explained that He impregnates the living entities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon material nature. And so in this instance, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hearing the devotee\u2019s words of love in offering foodstuffs is wholly identical with His eating and actually tasting. This point should be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand that the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it."}, {"verse": "TEXT 27", "devanagari": "\u092f\u0924\u094d\u0915\u0930\u094b\u0937\u093f \u092f\u0926\u0936\u094d\u0928\u200d\u093e\u0938\u093f \u092f\u091c\u094d\u091c\u200d\u0941\u0939\u094b\u0937\u093f \u0926\u0926\u093e\u0938\u093f \u092f\u0924\u094d \u0964\n\u092f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092a\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0938\u093f \u0915\u094c\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947\u092f \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0915\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0935 \u092e\u0926\u0930\u094d\u092a\u0923\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0968\u096d \u0965", "verse-text": "yat karo\u1e63i yad a\u015bn\u0101si\nyaj juho\u1e63i dad\u0101si yat\nyat tapasyasi kaunteya\ntat kuru\u1e63va mad-arpa\u1e47am", "synonyms": "yat \u2014 whatever; karo\u1e63i \u2014 you do; yat \u2014 whatever; a\u015bn\u0101si \u2014 you eat; yat \u2014 whatever; juho\u1e63i \u2014 you offer; dad\u0101si \u2014 you give away; yat \u2014 whatever; yat \u2014 whatever; tapasyasi \u2014 austerities you perform; kaunteya \u2014 O son of Kunt\u012b; tat \u2014 that; kuru\u1e63va \u2014 do; mat \u2014 unto Me; arpa\u1e47am \u2014 as an offering.", "translation": "Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give away, and whatever austerities you perform \u2013 do that, O son of Kunt\u012b, as an offering to Me.", "purport": "Thus, it is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in any circumstance.

Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits are given to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then that is called yukta-vair\u0101gya. Actually situated in renunciation, such activities clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor gradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore at the end he becomes liberated, and this liberation is also specified. By this liberation he does not become one with the brahma-jyotir, but rather enters into the planet of the Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here: m\u0101m upai\u1e63yasi, \u201che comes to Me,\u201d back home, back to Godhead. There are five different stages of liberation, and here it is specified that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here under the direction of the Supreme Lord, as stated, has evolved to the point where he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and engage directly in the association of the Supreme Lord.\n\nAnyone who has no interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the Lord is actually a sanny\u0101s\u012b. Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal servant, dependent on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, whatever he does, he does it for the benefit of the Lord. Whatever action he performs, he performs it as service to the Lord. He does not give serious attention to the fruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas. For ordinary persons it is obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas, but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of the Lord may sometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties, actually it is not so.\n\nIt is said, therefore, by Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava authorities that even the most intelligent person cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee. The exact words are t\u0101\u1e45ra v\u0101kya, kriy\u0101, mudr\u0101 vij\u00f1eha n\u0101 bujhaya (Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, Madhya 23.39). A person who is thus always engaged in the service of the Lord or is always thinking and planning how to serve the Lord is to be considered completely liberated at present, and in the future his going back home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed.

But this is not discrimination; it is natural. Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet he has a special interest in his own children. The Lord claims that every living entity \u2013 in whatever form \u2013 is His son, and so He provides everyone with a generous supply of the necessities of life. He is just like a cloud which pours rain all over, regardless of whether it falls on rock or land or water. But for His devotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they are always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and therefore they are always transcendentally situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The very phrase \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness\u201d suggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated in Him. The Lord says here distinctly, mayi te: \u201cThey are in Me.\u201d Naturally, as a result, the Lord is also in them. This is reciprocal. This also explains the words ye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante t\u0101\u1e41s tathaiva bhaj\u0101my aham: \u201cWhoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately I take care of him.\u201d This transcendental reciprocation exists because both the Lord and the devotee are conscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks very nice. The gold is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is glorified. The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord he looks like gold. The Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice. Living entities in a pure state are called devotees. The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His devotees. If a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then there is no personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the personalist philosophy there is.\n\nThe example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever one wants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the explanation is more complete. The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees. This is the manifestation of the Lord\u2019s special mercy to the devotees. The Lord\u2019s reciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma. It belongs to the transcendental situation in which the Lord and His devotees function.

When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds of activities: one is conditional, and the other is constitutional. As for protecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state, certainly there are different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the conditional life, and such activities are called conditional. Besides these, the living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which are called transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional position, and they are technically called devotional service. Now, in the conditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in relation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these activities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome condition. He knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive realization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most abominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown does not disqualify him. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that if a person falls down but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, purifies him and excuses him from that abomination. The material contamination is so strong that even a yog\u012b fully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes ensnared; but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at once rectified. Therefore the process of devotional service is always a success. No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the ideal path, for, as explained in the next verse, such occasional falldowns will be stopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nTherefore a person who is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and is engaged with determination in the process of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare should be considered to be in the transcendental position, even if by chance or accident he is found to have fallen. The words s\u0101dhur eva, \u201che is saintly,\u201d are very emphatic. They are a warning to the nondevotees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee should not be derided; he should still be considered saintly even if he has accidentally fallen down. And the word mantavya\u1e25 is still more emphatic. If one does not follow this rule, and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown, then one is disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord. The only qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service.\n\nIn the N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a the following statement is given:\n\nThe meaning is that even if one fully engaged in the devotional service of the Lord is sometimes found engaged in abominable activities, these activities should be considered to be like the spots that resemble the mark of a rabbit on the moon. Such spots do not become an impediment to the diffusion of moonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of saintly character does not make him abominable.\n\nOn the other hand, one should not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways; this verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material connections. Devotional service is more or less a declaration of war against the illusory energy. As long as one is not strong enough to fight the illusory energy, there may be accidental falldowns.

Generally, a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of devotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material contamination from the heart. He puts the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away. Continuous thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him pure by nature. According to the Vedas, there is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position he has to undergo certain ritualistic processes to purify himself. But here there is no such condition, because the purifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee, due to his remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly. Therefore, the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare should be continued without stoppage.

Sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here: that all devotional service should be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators do not know that there is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mind and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an ordinary human being; He is Absolute Truth. His body, His mind and He Himself are one and absolute. It is stated in the K\u016brma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, as it is quoted by Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Anubh\u0101\u1e63ya comments on Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Fifth Chapter, \u0100di-l\u012bl\u0101, verses 41\u201348), deha-dehi-vibhedo \u2019ya\u1e41 ne\u015bvare vidyate kvacit. This means that there is no difference in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But because the commentators do not know this science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they hide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and divide His personality from His mind or from His body. Although this is sheer ignorance of the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, some men make profit out of misleading people.\n\nThere are some who are demonic; they also think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but enviously, just like King Ka\u1e41sa, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s uncle. He was also thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always, but he thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would come to kill him. That kind of thinking will not help us. One should be thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional love. That is bhakti. One should cultivate the knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a continuously. What is that favorable cultivation? It is to learn from a bona fide teacher. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is not material, but is eternal, blissful knowledge. This kind of talk about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will help one become a devotee. Understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a otherwise, from the wrong source, will prove fruitless.\n\nOne should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; with conviction in his heart that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme, he should engage himself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in India for the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and devotional service is practiced there. When such practice is made, one has to offer obeisances to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should lower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, his body, his activities \u2013 everything. That will make one fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation. This will help one transfer to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. One should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators. One must engage in the nine different processes of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Pure devotional service is the highest achievement of human society.\n\nThe Seventh and Eighth chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 have explained pure devotional service to the Lord that is free from speculative knowledge, mystic yoga and fruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified may be attracted by different features of the Lord like the impersonal brahma-jyotir and localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the Supreme Lord.\n\nThere is a beautiful poem about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in which it is clearly stated that any person who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotee, in the beginning, may sometimes fall from the standard, but still he should be considered superior to all other philosophers and yog\u012bs. One who always engages in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be understood to be a perfectly saintly person. His accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will soon be situated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure devotee has no actual chance to fall down, because the Supreme Godhead personally takes care of His pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person should take directly to the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and happily live in this material world. He will eventually receive the supreme award of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}], "desc": ""}, {"name": "Chapter Ten: The Opulence of the Absolute", "link": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/10/advanced-view", "verses": [{"verse": "TEXT 1", "devanagari": "\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0935\u093e\u091a\n\u092d\u0942\u092f \u090f\u0935 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u092c\u093e\u0939\u094b \u0936\u200d\u0943\u0923\u0941 \u092e\u0947 \u092a\u0930\u092e\u0902 \u0935\u091a: \u0964\n\u092f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0947\u093d\u0939\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0923\u093e\u092f \u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u093f \u0939\u093f\u0924\u0915\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092f\u092f\u093e \u0965 \u0967 \u0965", "verse-text": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\nbh\u016bya eva mah\u0101-b\u0101ho\n\u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u me parama\u1e41 vaca\u1e25\nyat te \u2019ha\u1e41 pr\u012byam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya\nvak\u1e63y\u0101mi hita-k\u0101myay\u0101", "synonyms": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca \u2014 the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; bh\u016bya\u1e25 \u2014 again; eva \u2014 certainly; mah\u0101-b\u0101ho \u2014 O mighty-armed; \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u \u2014 just hear; me \u2014 My; paramam \u2014 supreme; vaca\u1e25 \u2014 instruction; yat \u2014 that which; te \u2014 to you; aham \u2014 I; pr\u012byam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya \u2014 thinking you dear to Me; vak\u1e63y\u0101mi \u2014 say; hita-k\u0101myay\u0101 \u2014 for your benefit.", "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Listen again, O mighty-armed Arjuna.

In the previous chapter He has clearly explained His different energies to establish devotion in firm conviction. Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna about His manifestations and various opulences.\n\nThe more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes fixed in devotional service. One should always hear about the Lord in the association of devotees; that will enhance one\u2019s devotional service. Discourses in the society of devotees can take place only among those who are really anxious to be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Others cannot take part in such discourses. The Lord clearly tells Arjuna that because Arjuna is very dear to Him, for his benefit such discourses are taking place."}, {"verse": "TEXT 2", "devanagari": "\u0928 \u092e\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941: \u0938\u0941\u0930\u0917\u0923\u093e: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u0935\u0902 \u0928 \u092e\u0939\u0930\u094d\u0937\u092f: \u0964\n\u0905\u0939\u092e\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0939\u093f \u0926\u0947\u0935\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u092e\u0939\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0940\u0923\u093e\u0902 \u091a \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0936: \u0965 \u0968 \u0965", "verse-text": "na me vidu\u1e25 sura-ga\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\nprabhava\u1e41 na mahar\u1e63aya\u1e25\naham \u0101dir hi dev\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\nmahar\u1e63\u012b\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 ca sarva\u015ba\u1e25", "synonyms": "na \u2014 never; me \u2014 My; vidu\u1e25 \u2014 know; sura-ga\u1e47\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 the demigods; prabhavam \u2014 origin, opulences; na \u2014 never; mah\u0101-\u1e5b\u1e63aya\u1e25 \u2014 great sages; aham \u2014 I am; \u0101di\u1e25 \u2014 the origin; hi \u2014 certainly; dev\u0101n\u0101m \u2014 of the demigods; mah\u0101-\u1e5b\u1e63\u012b\u1e47\u0101m \u2014 of the great sages; ca \u2014 also; sarva\u015ba\u1e25 \u2014 in all respects.", "translation": "Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin or opulences, for, in every respect, I am the source of the demigods and sages.", "purport": "As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord. No one is greater than Him; He is the cause of all causes. Here it is also stated by the Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the demigods and great sages cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; they can understand neither His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such wonderful, uncommon activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification necessary to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even the demigods and the great sages have tried to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also it is clearly said that even the great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities of material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, but it is not possible to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by such foolish speculation.\n\nHere the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth, \u201cHere I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the Supreme.\u201d One should know this. Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists. We can actually understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The conception of God as some ruling power or as the impersonal Brahman can be reached by persons who are in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position.\n\nBecause most men cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His actual situation, out of His causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite the Supreme Lord\u2019s uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme. Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord can understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of God; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a they can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No one else can understand Him. So even great sages agree: What is \u0101tm\u0101, what is the Supreme?

But out of those actually trying to understand their spiritual situation, one who can come to the understanding that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the proprietor of everything, the unborn, is the most successful spiritually realized person. In that stage only, when one has fully understood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful reactions.\n\nHere the Lord is described by the word aja, meaning \u201cunborn,\u201d but He is distinct from the living entities who are described in the Second Chapter as aja. The Lord is different from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to material attachment. The conditioned souls are changing their bodies, but His body is not changeable. Even when He comes to this material world, He comes as the same unborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said that the Lord, by His internal potency, is not under the inferior, material energy, but is always in the superior energy.\n\nIn this verse the words vetti loka-mahe\u015bvaram indicate that one should know that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme proprietor of the planetary systems of the universe. He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His creation. All the demigods were created within this material world, but as far as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is concerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is different even from the great demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva. And because He is the creator of Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme Person of all planets.\n\n\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone who knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful reactions. One must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the knowledge of the Supreme Lord. Only by devotional service can He be known and not by any other means, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\nOne should not try to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a human being. As stated previously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again expressed here in a different way. A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent enough to understand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always free from all sinful reactions.\n\nIf K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is known as the son of Devak\u012b, then how can He be unborn? That is also explained in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: When He appeared before Devak\u012b and Vasudeva, He was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His original form, and then He transformed Himself into an ordinary child.\n\nAnything done under the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental. It cannot be contaminated by material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious. The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material world is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in the material world. Everything is inauspicious because the very material nature is inauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious. Real auspiciousness depends on activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in full devotion and service. Therefore if we at all want our activities to be auspicious, then we should work under the directions of the Supreme Lord. Such directions are given in authoritative scriptures such as \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, or from a bona fide spiritual master. Because the spiritual master is the representative of the Supreme Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord. The spiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way. There is no contradiction in these three sources. All actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this material world. The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called sanny\u0101sa. As stated in the first verse of the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one who acts as a matter of duty because he has been ordered to do so by the Supreme Lord, and who does not seek shelter in the fruits of his activities (an\u0101\u015brita\u1e25 karma-phalam), is a true renouncer. Anyone acting under the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sanny\u0101s\u012b and a yog\u012b, and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the sanny\u0101s\u012b, or a pseudo yog\u012b."}, {"verse": "TEXTS 4-5", "devanagari": "\u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0930\u094d\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u092e\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092e\u094b\u0939: \u0915\u094d\u0937\u092e\u093e \u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u0926\u092e: \u0936\u092e: \u0964\n\u0938\u0941\u0916\u0902 \u0926\u0941:\u0916\u0902 \u092d\u0935\u094b\u093d\u092d\u093e\u0935\u094b \u092d\u092f\u0902 \u091a\u093e\u092d\u092f\u092e\u0947\u0935 \u091a \u0965 \u096a \u0965\n\u0905\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0938\u093e \u0938\u092e\u0924\u093e \u0924\u0941\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u092a\u094b \u0926\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u092f\u0936\u094b\u093d\u092f\u0936: \u0964\n\u092d\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092d\u093e\u0935\u093e \u092d\u0942\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u092e\u0924\u094d\u0924 \u090f\u0935 \u092a\u0943\u0925\u0917\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093e: \u0965 \u096b \u0965", "verse-text": "buddhir j\u00f1\u0101nam asammoha\u1e25\nk\u1e63am\u0101 satya\u1e41 dama\u1e25 \u015bama\u1e25\nsukha\u1e41 du\u1e25kha\u1e41 bhavo \u2019bh\u0101vo\nbhaya\u1e41 c\u0101bhayam eva ca\n\nahi\u1e41s\u0101 samat\u0101 tu\u1e63\u1e6dis\ntapo d\u0101na\u1e41 ya\u015bo \u2019ya\u015ba\u1e25\nbhavanti bh\u0101v\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\nmatta eva p\u1e5bthag-vidh\u0101\u1e25", "synonyms": "buddhi\u1e25 \u2014 intelligence; j\u00f1\u0101nam \u2014 knowledge; asammoha\u1e25 \u2014 freedom from doubt; k\u1e63am\u0101 \u2014 forgiveness; satyam \u2014 truthfulness; dama\u1e25 \u2014 control of the senses; \u015bama\u1e25 \u2014 control of the mind; sukham \u2014 happiness; du\u1e25kham \u2014 distress; bhava\u1e25 \u2014 birth; abh\u0101va\u1e25 \u2014 death; bhayam \u2014 fear; ca \u2014 also; abhayam \u2014 fearlessness; eva \u2014 also; ca \u2014 and; ahi\u1e41s\u0101 \u2014 nonviolence; samat\u0101 \u2014 equilibrium; tu\u1e63\u1e6di\u1e25 \u2014 satisfaction; tapa\u1e25 \u2014 penance; d\u0101nam \u2014 charity; ya\u015ba\u1e25 \u2014 fame; aya\u015ba\u1e25 \u2014 infamy; bhavanti \u2014 come about; bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 natures; bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m \u2014 of living entities; matta\u1e25 \u2014 from Me; eva \u2014 certainly; p\u1e5bthak-vidh\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 variously arranged.", "translation": "Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from doubt and delusion, forgiveness, truthfulness, control of the senses, control of the mind, happiness and distress, birth, death, fear, fearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame and infamy \u2013 all these various qualities of living beings are created by Me alone.", "purport": "The different qualities of living entities, be they good or bad, are all created by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they are described here.\n\nIntelligence refers to the power to analyze things in their proper perspective, and knowledge refers to understanding what is spirit and what is matter. Ordinary knowledge obtained by a university education pertains only to matter, and it is not accepted here as knowledge. Knowledge means knowing the distinction between spirit and matter. In modern education there is no knowledge about spirit; they are simply taking care of the material elements and bodily needs. Therefore academic knowledge is not complete.\n\nAsammoha, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is not hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly but surely he becomes free from bewilderment. Nothing should be accepted blindly; everything should be accepted with care and with caution. K\u1e63am\u0101, tolerance and forgiveness, should be practiced; one should be tolerant and excuse the minor offenses of others. Satyam, truthfulness, means that facts should be presented as they are, for the benefit of others. Facts should not be misrepresented. According to social conventions, it is said that one can speak the truth only when it is palatable to others. But that is not truthfulness. The truth should be spoken in a straightforward way, so that others will understand actually what the facts are. If a man is a thief and if people are warned that he is a thief, that is truth. Although sometimes the truth is unpalatable, one should not refrain from speaking it. Truthfulness demands that the facts be presented as they are for the benefit of others. That is the definition of truth.\n\nControl of the senses means that the senses should not be used for unnecessary personal enjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the proper needs of the senses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for spiritual advancement. Therefore the senses should be restrained from unnecessary use. Similarly, one should restrain the mind from unnecessary thoughts; that is called \u015bama. One should not spend one\u2019s time pondering over earning money. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind should be used to understand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be presented authoritatively. The power of thought should be developed in association with persons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons and spiritual masters and those whose thinking is highly developed. Sukham, pleasure or happiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the cultivation of the spiritual knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And similarly, that which is painful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for the cultivation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Anything favorable for the development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be accepted, and anything unfavorable should be rejected.\n\nBhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body. As far as the soul is concerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the beginning of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Birth and death apply to one\u2019s embodiment in the material world. Fear is due to worrying about the future. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. Therefore his future is very bright. Others, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no knowledge of what the next life holds. So they are therefore in constant anxiety. If we want to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and be situated always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In that way we will be free from all fear. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.2.37) it is stated, bhaya\u1e41 dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101t: fear is caused by our absorption in the illusory energy. But those who are free from the illusory energy, those who are confident that they are not the material body, that they are spiritual parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who are therefore engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to fear. Their future is very bright. This fear is a condition of persons who are not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Abhayam, fearlessness, is possible only for one in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nAhi\u1e41s\u0101, nonviolence, means that one should not do anything which will put others into misery or confusion. Material activities that are promised by so many politicians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good results because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental vision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society. Ahi\u1e41s\u0101 means that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of the human body can be achieved. The human body is meant for spiritual realization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that end commit violence on the human body. That which furthers the future spiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence.\n\nSamat\u0101, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be very much attached or to be very much detached is not the best. This material world should be accepted without attachment or aversion. That which is favorable for prosecuting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be accepted; that which is unfavorable should be rejected. That is called samat\u0101, equanimity. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept save in terms of its usefulness in the prosecution of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nTu\u1e63\u1e6di, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and more material goods by unnecessary activity. One should be satisfied with whatever is obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called satisfaction. Tapas means austerity or penance. There are many rules and regulations in the Vedas which apply here, like rising early in the morning and taking a bath. Sometimes it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning, but whatever voluntary trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance. Similarly, there are prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month. One may not be inclined to practice such fasting, but because of his determination to make advancement in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he should accept such bodily troubles when they are recommended. However, one should not fast unnecessarily or against Vedic injunctions. One should not fast for some political purpose; that is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as fasting in ignorance, and anything done in ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual advancement. Everything done in the mode of goodness does advance one, however, and fasting done in terms of the Vedic injunctions enriches one in spiritual knowledge.\n\nAs far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings to some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in terms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but the best cause. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is good, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be given to a person who is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. According to the Vedic literature, it is enjoined that charity should be given to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. This practice is still followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic injunction. But still the injunction is that charity should be given to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Why? Because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual knowledge. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding Brahman. Brahma j\u0101n\u0101t\u012bti br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u1e25: one who knows Brahman is called a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Thus charity is offered to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as because they are always engaged in higher spiritual service and have no time to earn their livelihood. In the Vedic literature, charity is also to be awarded to one in the renounced order of life, the sanny\u0101s\u012b. The sanny\u0101s\u012bs beg from door to door, not for money but for missionary purposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken the householders from the slumber of ignorance. Because the householders are engaged in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in life \u2013 awakening their K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2013 it is the business of the sanny\u0101s\u012bs to go as beggars to the householders and encourage them to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. As it is said in the Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due him in this human form of life. This knowledge and method is distributed by the sanny\u0101s\u012bs; hence charity is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and similar good causes, not to any whimsical cause.\n\nYa\u015bas, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is famous when he is known as a great devotee. That is real fame. If one has become a great man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and it is known, then he is truly famous. One who does not have such fame is infamous.\n\nAll these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and in the society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on other planets, and these qualities are there. Now, for one who wants to advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a creates all these qualities, but the person develops them himself from within. One who engages in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the Supreme Lord.\n\nOf whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nothing can manifest itself in this material world which is not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is knowledge; although we know that things are differently situated, we should realize that everything flows from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}, {"verse": "TEXT 6", "devanagari": "\u092e\u0939\u0930\u094d\u0937\u092f: \u0938\u092a\u094d\u200d\u0924 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u091a\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u094b \u092e\u0928\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0925\u093e \u0964\n\u092e\u0926\u094d\u092d\u200d\u093e\u0935\u093e \u092e\u093e\u0928\u0938\u093e \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093e \u092f\u0947\u0937\u093e\u0902 \u0932\u094b\u0915 \u0907\u092e\u093e: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u093e: \u0965 \u096c \u0965", "verse-text": "mahar\u1e63aya\u1e25 sapta p\u016brve\ncatv\u0101ro manavas tath\u0101\nmad-bh\u0101v\u0101 m\u0101nas\u0101 j\u0101t\u0101\nye\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 loka im\u0101\u1e25 praj\u0101\u1e25", "synonyms": "mah\u0101-\u1e5b\u1e63aya\u1e25 \u2014 the great sages; sapta \u2014 seven; p\u016brve \u2014 before; catv\u0101ra\u1e25 \u2014 four; manava\u1e25 \u2014 Manus; tath\u0101 \u2014 also; mat-bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 born of Me; m\u0101nas\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 from the mind; j\u0101t\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 born; ye\u1e63\u0101m \u2014 of them; loke \u2014 in the world; im\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 all this; praj\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 population.", "translation": "The seven great sages and before them the four other great sages and the Manus [progenitors of mankind] come from Me, born from My mind, and all the living beings populating the various planets descend from them.", "purport": "The Lord is giving a genealogical synopsis of the universal population.

Their minds cannot be diverted from the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Their talks are solely on the transcendental subjects. The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse specifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours daily engaged in glorifying the qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Lord. Their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they take pleasure in discussing Him with other devotees.\n\nIn the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually situated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental position, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and enters into the brahma-jyotir effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet, which is called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the supreme planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and rests there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya-l\u012bl\u0101, Chapter Nineteen). It is explained there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water.

We may remember that in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him of many things and that He would instruct him in the way of buddhi-yoga. Now buddhi-yoga is explained. Buddhi-yoga itself is action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; that is the highest intelligence. Buddhi means intelligence, and yoga means mystic activities or mystic elevation. When one tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service, his action is called buddhi-yoga. In other words, buddhi-yoga is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal of progress is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. People do not know this; therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important. One should know that the goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved.\n\nWhen a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of activities, he is acting in karma-yoga. When he knows that the goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is acting in j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. And when he knows the goal and seeks K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a completely in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga, or buddhi-yoga, which is the complete yoga. This complete yoga is the highest perfectional stage of life.\n\nA person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a spiritual organization, but if he is still not intelligent enough to make progress, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come to Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a person always engage himself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of services. He should perform some sort of work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that work should be with love.

Prak\u0101\u015b\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b, a very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion. But even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nThe M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure knowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic principles, are still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.\n\nThe Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, simply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible to understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort. Man can go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Supreme Truth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, pleased, and by His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee. The pure devotee always has K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within his heart; and with the presence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is just like the sun, the darkness of ignorance is at once dissipated. This is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nDue to the contamination of material association, through many, many millions of births, one\u2019s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, but when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the dust quickly clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge. The ultimate goal, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service, and not by mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not have to worry about the material necessities of life; he need not be anxious, because when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme Lord, who is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee. This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. By studying Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one can become a soul completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure devotional service.

Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in this chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly declares, \u201cYou are para\u1e41 brahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d And previously K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stated that He is the originator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and every human being is dependent on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that they are absolute and independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service. This has already been explained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now, by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It is not that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Arjuna\u2019s intimate friend Arjuna is flattering Him by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. Whatever Arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse spoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.\n\nIn the Kena Upani\u1e63ad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for everything, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has already explained that everything is resting on Him. The Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him. This constant thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is smara\u1e47am, one of the methods of devotional service. It is only by devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that one can understand his position and get rid of this material body.\n\nIn the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One who understands that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the purest of the pure can become purified from all sinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he surrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna\u2019s acceptance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is also confirmed by great personalities, of whom N\u0101rada is the chief.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon Him and enjoy one\u2019s transcendental relationship with Him. He is the supreme existence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. Not only does Arjuna confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures, the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and histories. In all Vedic literatures K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is thus described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, \u201cAlthough I am unborn, I appear on this earth to establish religious principles.\u201d He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him. This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.\n\nHere Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If we want to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, we should accept the statements in these two verses. This is called the parampar\u0101 system, acceptance of the disciplic succession. Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. It is not possible by so-called academic education. Unfortunately those proud of their academic education, despite so much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an ordinary person."}, {"verse": "TEXT 14", "devanagari": "\u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u092e\u0947\u0924\u0926\u0943\u0924\u0902 \u092e\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0947 \u092f\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0935\u0926\u0938\u093f \u0915\u0947\u0936\u0935 \u0964\n\u0928 \u0939\u093f \u0924\u0947 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0935\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0947\u0935\u093e \u0928 \u0926\u093e\u0928\u0935\u093e: \u0965 \u0967\u096a \u0965", "verse-text": "sarvam etad \u1e5bta\u1e41 manye\nyan m\u0101\u1e41 vadasi ke\u015bava\nna hi te bhagavan vyakti\u1e41\nvidur dev\u0101 na d\u0101nav\u0101\u1e25", "synonyms": "sarvam \u2014 all; etat \u2014 this; \u1e5btam \u2014 truth; manye \u2014 I accept; yat \u2014 which; m\u0101m \u2014 unto me; vadasi \u2014 You tell; ke\u015bava \u2014 O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; na \u2014 never; hi \u2014 certainly; te \u2014 Your; bhagavan \u2014 O Personality of Godhead; vyaktim \u2014 revelation; vidu\u1e25 \u2014 can know; dev\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 the demigods; na \u2014 nor; d\u0101nav\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 the demons.", "translation": "O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I totally accept as truth all that You have told me.

By the grace of the Supreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and that He is the perfect one. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He received the authority of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As described in the Fourth Chapter, the parampar\u0101 system of disciplic succession for the understanding of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was lost, and therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee.

The acceptance by Arjuna of all that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says should be emulated; then we can understand the essence of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and then only can we understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead."}, {"verse": "TEXT 15", "devanagari": "\u0938\u094d\u0935\u092f\u092e\u0947\u0935\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u0935\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0925 \u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e \u0964\n\u092d\u0942\u0924\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0928 \u092d\u0942\u0924\u0947\u0936 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u091c\u0917\u0924\u094d\u092a\u0924\u0947 \u0965 \u0967\u096b \u0965", "verse-text": "svayam ev\u0101tman\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41\nvettha tva\u1e41 puru\u1e63ottama\nbh\u016bta-bh\u0101vana bh\u016bte\u015ba\ndeva-deva jagat-pate", "synonyms": "svayam \u2014 personally; eva \u2014 certainly; \u0101tman\u0101 \u2014 by Yourself; \u0101tm\u0101nam \u2014 Yourself; vettha \u2014 know; tvam \u2014 You; puru\u1e63a-uttama \u2014 O greatest of all persons; bh\u016bta-bh\u0101vana \u2014 O origin of everything; bh\u016bta-\u012b\u015ba \u2014 O Lord of everything; deva-deva \u2014 O Lord of all demigods; jagat-pate \u2014 O Lord of the entire universe.", "translation": "Indeed, You alone know Yourself by Your own internal potency, O Supreme Person, origin of all, Lord of all beings, God of gods, Lord of the universe!", "purport": "The Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can be known by persons who are in a relationship with Him through the discharge of devotional service, like Arjuna and his followers. Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Mental speculation that leads one away from the Supreme Lord is a serious sin, and one who does not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should not try to comment on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the statement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and since it is the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it should be understood from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Arjuna understood it. It should not be received from atheistic persons.\n\nAs stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.11):\n\nThe Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A common man or even a liberated man who has realized impersonal Brahman or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 may not understand God\u2019s personality. Such men, therefore, may endeavor to understand the Supreme Person from the verses of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which are being spoken by this person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Sometimes the impersonalists accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Bhagav\u0101n, or they accept His authority. Yet many liberated persons cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Puru\u1e63ottama, the Supreme Person. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Puru\u1e63ottama. Yet one still may not understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the father of all living entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Bh\u016bta-bh\u0101vana. And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is addressed here as Bh\u016bte\u015ba, the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Deva-deva, the worshipful God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as the worshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme proprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagat-pati. Thus the truth about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we should follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is."}, {"verse": "TEXT 16", "devanagari": "\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0941\u092e\u0930\u094d\u0939\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0936\u0947\u0937\u0947\u0923 \u0926\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0935\u093f\u092d\u0942\u0924\u092f: \u0964\n\u092f\u093e\u092d\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093f\u092d\u0942\u0924\u093f\u092d\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0932\u094b\u0915\u093e\u0928\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092a\u094d\u092f \u0924\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0938\u093f \u0965 \u0967\u096c \u0965", "verse-text": "vaktum arhasy a\u015be\u1e63e\u1e47a\ndivy\u0101 hy \u0101tma-vibh\u016btaya\u1e25\ny\u0101bhir vibh\u016btibhir lok\u0101n\nim\u0101\u1e41s tva\u1e41 vy\u0101pya ti\u1e63\u1e6dhasi", "synonyms": "vaktum \u2014 to say; arhasi \u2014 You deserve; a\u015be\u1e63e\u1e47a \u2014 in detail; divy\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 divine; hi \u2014 certainly; \u0101tma \u2014 Your own; vibh\u016btaya\u1e25 \u2014 opulences; y\u0101bhi\u1e25 \u2014 by which; vibh\u016btibhi\u1e25 \u2014 opulences; lok\u0101n \u2014 all the planets; im\u0101n \u2014 these; tvam \u2014 You; vy\u0101pya \u2014 pervading; ti\u1e63\u1e6dhasi \u2014 remain.", "translation": "Please tell me in detail of Your divine opulences by which You pervade all these worlds.", "purport": "In this verse it appears that Arjuna is already satisfied with his understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Thus this address by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Arjuna is significant. Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various opulences.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first informs Arjuna that He is the soul of the entire cosmic manifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation, the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the puru\u1e63a incarnation, and from Him everything begins. Therefore He is \u0101tm\u0101, the soul of the mahat-tattva, the universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause of the creation; actually the Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u enters into the mahat-tattva, the total material energy. He is the soul. When Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u enters into the manifested universes, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every entity. We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the presence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the spiritual spark, the body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation cannot develop unless the Supreme Soul, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, enters.

V\u0101sudeva is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s immediate expansion, so V\u0101sudeva is not different from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is to be understood that the V\u0101sudeva referred to in this verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is Baladeva, or Balar\u0101ma, because He is the original source of all incarnations and thus He is the sole source of V\u0101sudeva. The immediate expansions of the Lord are called sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba (personal expansions), and there are also expansions called vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba (separated expansions).\n\nAmongst the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, Arjuna is famous as Dhana\u00f1jaya. He is the best of men and therefore represents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Among the munis, or learned men conversant in Vedic knowledge, Vy\u0101sa is the greatest because he explained Vedic knowledge in many different ways for the understanding of the common mass of people in this Age of Kali. And Vy\u0101sa is also known as an incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore Vy\u0101sa also represents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Kavis are those who are capable of thinking thoroughly on any subject matter. Among the kavis, U\u015ban\u0101, \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya, was the spiritual master of the demons; he was an extremely intelligent and far-seeing politician. Thus \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya is another representative of the opulence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}, {"verse": "TEXT 38", "devanagari": "\u0926\u0923\u094d\u0921\u094b \u0926\u092e\u092f\u0924\u093e\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f \u0928\u0940\u0924\u093f\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f \u091c\u093f\u0917\u0940\u0937\u0924\u093e\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u092e\u094c\u0928\u0902 \u091a\u0948\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f \u0917\u0941\u0939\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0935\u0924\u093e\u092e\u0939\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0969\u096e \u0965", "verse-text": "da\u1e47\u1e0do damayat\u0101m asmi\nn\u012btir asmi jig\u012b\u1e63at\u0101m\nmauna\u1e41 caiv\u0101smi guhy\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\nj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101navat\u0101m aham", "synonyms": "da\u1e47\u1e0da\u1e25 \u2014 punishment; damayat\u0101m \u2014 of all means of suppression; asmi \u2014 I am; n\u012bti\u1e25 \u2014 morality; asmi \u2014 I am; jig\u012b\u1e63at\u0101m \u2014 of those who seek victory; maunam \u2014 silence; ca \u2014 and; eva \u2014 also; asmi \u2014 I am; guhy\u0101n\u0101m \u2014 of secrets; j\u00f1\u0101nam \u2014 knowledge; j\u00f1\u0101na-vat\u0101m \u2014 of the wise; aham \u2014 I am.", "translation": "Among all means of suppressing lawlessness I am punishment, and of those who seek victory I am morality.

The Lord here tells Arjuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and grandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s entering them as Supersoul. From Brahm\u0101, the most gigantic entity, on down to the smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each and all and is sustaining them.\n\nThere is a Mission that regularly propounds that worship of any demigod will lead one to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the supreme goal. But worship of demigods is thoroughly discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva represent only part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord. He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him. He is asamaurdhva, which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal to Him. In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the same category with demigods \u2013 be they even Brahm\u0101 or \u015aiva \u2013 becomes at once an atheist. If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, then one can understand without any doubt the position of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and can fix his mind in the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in full devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental position. Devotional service and worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses 8 through 11. That is the way of pure devotional service. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this chapter. \u015ar\u012bla Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a, a great \u0101c\u0101rya in disciplic succession from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, concludes his commentary on this chapter by saying,\n\nFrom Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s potent energy even the powerful sun gets its power, and by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s partial expansion the whole world is maintained.

That has been completely explained in the last chapter.\n\nNow, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This means that Arjuna no longer thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a mere human being, as a friend of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad that he has such a great friend as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but now he is thinking that although he may accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the source of everything, others may not. So in order to establish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s divinity for all, he is requesting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this chapter to show His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind that after showing it He converts Himself again into His original form.

To see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna is told not to change his mind but his vision. The universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not very important; that will be clear in subsequent verses. Yet because Arjuna wanted to see it, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal form.\n\nDevotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences. The playmates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the parents of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never want K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to show His opulences. They are so immersed in pure love that they do not even know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their loving exchange they forget that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that the boys who play with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are all highly pious souls, and after many, many births they are able to play with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such boys do not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They take Him as a personal friend. Therefore \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b recites this verse:\n\n\u201cHere is the Supreme Person, who is considered the impersonal Brahman by great sages, the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotees, and a product of material nature by ordinary men. Now these boys, who have performed many, many pious activities in their past lives, are playing with that Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam 10.12.11)\n\nThe fact is that the devotee is not concerned with seeing the vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa, the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it to substantiate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s statements so that in the future people could understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not only theoretically or philosophically presented Himself as the Supreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna. Arjuna must confirm this because Arjuna is the beginning of the parampar\u0101 system. Those who are actually interested in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and who follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not only theoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as the Supreme.\n\nThe Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form because He knew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have already explained."}, {"verse": "TEXT 9", "devanagari": "\u0938\u091e\u094d\u091c\u092f \u0909\u0935\u093e\u091a\n\u090f\u0935\u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e \u0924\u0924\u094b \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0939\u093e\u092f\u094b\u0917\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094b \u0939\u0930\u093f: \u0964\n\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u092f\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0938 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093e\u092f \u092a\u0930\u092e\u0902 \u0930\u0942\u092a\u092e\u0948\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u096f \u0965", "verse-text": "sa\u00f1jaya uv\u0101ca\nevam uktv\u0101 tato r\u0101jan\nmah\u0101-yoge\u015bvaro hari\u1e25\ndar\u015bay\u0101m \u0101sa p\u0101rth\u0101ya\nparama\u1e41 r\u016bpam ai\u015bvaram", "synonyms": "sa\u00f1jaya\u1e25 uv\u0101ca \u2014 Sa\u00f1jaya said; evam \u2014 thus; uktv\u0101 \u2014 saying; tata\u1e25 \u2014 thereafter; r\u0101jan \u2014 O King; mah\u0101-yoga-\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 \u2014 the most powerful mystic; hari\u1e25 \u2014 the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; dar\u015bay\u0101m \u0101sa \u2014 showed; p\u0101rth\u0101ya \u2014 unto Arjuna; paramam \u2014 the divine; r\u016bpam ai\u015bvaram \u2014 universal form.", "translation": "Sa\u00f1jaya said: O King, having spoken thus, the Supreme Lord of all mystic power, the Personality of Godhead, displayed His universal form to Arjuna."}, {"verse": "TEXTS 10-11", "devanagari": "\u0905\u0928\u0947\u0915\u0935\u0915\u094d\u200d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0928\u092f\u0928\u092e\u0928\u0947\u0915\u093e\u0926\u094d\u092d\u200d\u0941\u0924\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0928\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u0905\u0928\u0947\u0915\u0926\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092d\u0930\u0923\u0902 \u0926\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u0947\u0915\u094b\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0924\u093e\u092f\u0941\u0927\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0967\u0966 \u0965\n\u0926\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0932\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0930\u0927\u0930\u0902 \u0926\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u0917\u0928\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0932\u0947\u092a\u0928\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0936\u094d\u091a\u0930\u094d\u092f\u092e\u092f\u0902 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u092e\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0924\u094b\u092e\u0941\u0916\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0967\u0967 \u0965", "verse-text": "aneka-vaktra-nayanam\nanek\u0101dbhuta-dar\u015banam\naneka-divy\u0101bhara\u1e47a\u1e41\ndivy\u0101nekodyat\u0101yudham\n\ndivya-m\u0101ly\u0101mbara-dhara\u1e41\ndivya-gandh\u0101nulepanam\nsarv\u0101\u015bcarya-maya\u1e41 devam\nananta\u1e41 vi\u015bvato-mukham", "synonyms": "aneka \u2014 various; vaktra \u2014 mouths; nayanam \u2014 eyes; aneka \u2014 various; adbhuta \u2014 wonderful; dar\u015banam \u2014 sights; aneka \u2014 many; divya \u2014 divine; \u0101bhara\u1e47am \u2014 ornaments; divya \u2014 divine; aneka \u2014 various; udyata \u2014 uplifted; \u0101yudham \u2014 weapons; divya \u2014 divine; m\u0101lya \u2014 garlands; ambara \u2014 dresses; dharam \u2014 wearing; divya \u2014 divine; gandha \u2014 fragrances; anulepanam \u2014 smeared with; sarva \u2014 all; \u0101\u015bcarya-mayam \u2014 wonderful; devam \u2014 shining; anantam \u2014 unlimited; vi\u015bvata\u1e25-mukham \u2014 all-pervading.", "translation": "Arjuna saw in that universal form unlimited mouths, unlimited eyes, unlimited wonderful visions.

This word is also very significant. The whole world is moving according to the plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

There are many so-called scientists who suggest that perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of \u201cperhaps\u201d and \u201cmaybe.\u201d There is a specific plan being carried out in this material world. What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home. As long as they have the domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature, they are conditioned. But anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is most intelligent.

Arjuna especially mentions that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is greater than Brahm\u0101 because Brahm\u0101 is created by Him.

It is stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that the Lord is respected by Lord \u015aiva and Brahm\u0101 and similar other demigods. The word ak\u1e63aram is very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction but the Lord is above this material creation.

He is the spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to Brahm\u0101 and presently He is also instructing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to Arjuna; therefore He is the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without being a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental subject matter.\n\nThe Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects.

No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because no one is equal to or higher than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within any manifestation, spiritual or material. Everyone is below Him. No one can excel Him. This is stated in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (6.8):\n\nThe Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him there is no difference between His senses, His body, His mind and Himself. Foolish persons who do not perfectly know Him say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is different from His soul, mind, heart and everything else. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is absolute; therefore His activities and potencies are supreme. It is also stated that although He does not have senses like ours, He can perform all sensory activities; therefore His senses are neither imperfect nor limited. No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to Him, and everyone is lower than Him.\n\nThe knowledge, strength and activities of the Supreme Personality are all transcendental. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9):\n\nWhoever knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental body, activities and perfection, after quitting his body, returns to Him and doesn\u2019t come back again to this miserable world. Therefore one should know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities are different from others. The best policy is to follow the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that will make one perfect. It is also stated that there is no one who is master of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; everyone is His servant.

Who can have divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of divinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are demigods (vi\u1e63\u1e47u-bhakta\u1e25 sm\u1e5bto daiva\u1e25). Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or who recognize only the impersonal part of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not possible to decry K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and at the same time have the divine vision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine. In other words, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna.\n\nThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 gives the description of the universal form. Although this description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna, now one can have some idea of the vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa after this incident. Those who are actually divine can see the universal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without being a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine nature and who have divine vision, are not very much interested in seeing the universal form of the Lord. As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and he was actually afraid of the universal form.\n\nIn this verse there are some significant words, just like veda-yaj\u00f1\u0101dhyayanai\u1e25, which refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial regulations. Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, such as the four Vedas (\u1e5ag, Yajur, S\u0101ma and Atharva) and the eighteen Pur\u0101\u1e47as, the Upani\u1e63ads and the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. One can study these at home or anywhere else. Similarly, there are s\u016btras \u2013 Kalpa-s\u016btras and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101-s\u016btras \u2013 for studying the method of sacrifice. D\u0101nai\u1e25 refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party, such as those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord \u2013 the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Similarly, \u201cpious activities\u201d refers to the agni-hotra and the prescribed duties of the different castes. And the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains is called tapasya. So one can perform all these \u2013 can accept bodily penances, give charity, study the Vedas, etc. \u2013 but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to see that universal form. Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we understand that the impersonalists are not devotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord.\n\nThere are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an ordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should follow the principles of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, otherwise there is no possibility of attaining perfect spiritual knowledge. Although Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is considered the preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that it enables one to distinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form, but that is unacceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one becomes a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one cannot see the universal form of God. So one first of all has to become a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; then he can claim that he can show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations."}, {"verse": "TEXT 49", "devanagari": "\u092e\u093e \u0924\u0947 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u0925\u093e \u092e\u093e \u091a \u0935\u093f\u092e\u0942\u0922\u092d\u093e\u0935\u094b\n\u0926\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0935\u093e \u0930\u0942\u092a\u0902 \u0918\u094b\u0930\u092e\u0940\u0926\u0943\u0919\u094d\u200d\u092e\u092e\u0947\u0926\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092a\u0947\u0924\u092d\u0940: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0924\u092e\u0928\u093e: \u092a\u0941\u0928\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902\n\u0924\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092e\u0947 \u0930\u0942\u092a\u092e\u093f\u0926\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092a\u0936\u094d\u092f \u0965 \u096a\u096f \u0965", "verse-text": "m\u0101 te vyath\u0101 m\u0101 ca vim\u016b\u1e0dha-bh\u0101vo\nd\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 r\u016bpa\u1e41 ghoram \u012bd\u1e5b\u1e45 mamedam\nvyapeta-bh\u012b\u1e25 pr\u012bta-man\u0101\u1e25 punas tva\u1e41\ntad eva me r\u016bpam ida\u1e41 prapa\u015bya", "synonyms": "m\u0101 \u2014 let it not be; te \u2014 unto you; vyath\u0101 \u2014 trouble; m\u0101 \u2014 let it not be; ca \u2014 also; vim\u016b\u1e0dha-bh\u0101va\u1e25 \u2014 bewilderment; d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 \u2014 by seeing; r\u016bpam \u2014 form; ghoram \u2014 horrible; \u012bd\u1e5bk \u2014 as it is; mama \u2014 My; idam \u2014 this; vyapeta-bh\u012b\u1e25 \u2014 free from all fear; pr\u012bta-man\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 pleased in mind; puna\u1e25 \u2014 again; tvam \u2014 you; tat \u2014 that; eva \u2014 thus; me \u2014 My; r\u016bpam \u2014 form; idam \u2014 this; prapa\u015bya \u2014 just see.", "translation": "You have been perturbed and bewildered by seeing this horrible feature of Mine.

One may be able to see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penances, Vedic study and philosophical speculation. It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti one cannot see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal form, the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with two hands is still more difficult to see, even for demigods like Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva. They desire to see Him, and we have evidence in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that when He was supposed to be in the womb of His mother, Devak\u012b, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they offered nice prayers to the Lord, although He was not at that time visible to them. They waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, thinking Him an ordinary person, and may offer respect not to Him but to the impersonal \u201csomething\u201d within Him, but these are all nonsensical postures. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His two-armed form is actually desired to be seen by demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva.\n\nIn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11) it is also confirmed, avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam: He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body, as confirmed by Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and confirmed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for some who make a study of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by reading Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or similar Vedic scriptures, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a problem. For one using a material process, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned philosopher, but He is an ordinary man, and even though He was so powerful He had to accept a material body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and consider Him to be less important than the universal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form. According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person. But the transcendental process is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Chapter Four: to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are actually in the Vedic line hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from authority, and by repeated hearing about Him, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is covered by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is confirmed in the Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute Truth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and by devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can have his spiritual eyes opened and can see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even for the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His two-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still more difficult to understand His personal form as \u015ay\u0101masundara."}, {"verse": "TEXT 53", "devanagari": "\u0928\u093e\u0939\u0902 \u0935\u0947\u0926\u0948\u0930\u094d\u0928 \u0924\u092a\u0938\u093e \u0928 \u0926\u093e\u0928\u0947\u0928 \u0928 \u091a\u0947\u091c\u094d\u092f\u092f\u093e \u0964\n\u0936\u0915\u094d\u092f \u090f\u0935\u0902\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094b \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0941\u0902 \u0926\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0938\u093f \u092e\u093e\u0902 \u092f\u0925\u093e \u0965 \u096b\u0969 \u0965", "verse-text": "n\u0101ha\u1e41 vedair na tapas\u0101\nna d\u0101nena na cejyay\u0101\n\u015bakya eva\u1e41-vidho dra\u1e63\u1e6du\u1e41\nd\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dav\u0101n asi m\u0101\u1e41 yath\u0101", "synonyms": "na \u2014 never; aham \u2014 I; vedai\u1e25 \u2014 by study of the Vedas; na \u2014 never; tapas\u0101 \u2014 by serious penances; na \u2014 never; d\u0101nena \u2014 by charity; na \u2014 never; ca \u2014 also; ijyay\u0101 \u2014 by worship; \u015bakya\u1e25 \u2014 it is possible; evam-vidha\u1e25 \u2014 like this; dra\u1e63\u1e6dum \u2014 to see; d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dav\u0101n \u2014 seeing; asi \u2014 you are; m\u0101m \u2014 Me; yath\u0101 \u2014 as.", "translation": "The form you are seeing with your transcendental eyes cannot be understood simply by studying the Vedas, nor by undergoing serious penances, nor by charity, nor by worship.

He explicitly explains this in this verse so that unauthorized commentators, who try to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form. These things are very difficult to understand by study of the Vedas or by philosophical speculation. Therefore it is clearly stated here that no one can see Him or enter into understanding of these matters. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. For example, to undergo serious penances one may observe fasting on Janm\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b, the day on which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared, and on the two days of Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b (the eleventh day after the new moon and the eleventh day after the full moon). As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a philosophy, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, throughout the world. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was appreciated by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b as the most munificent man of charity because love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. So if one gives some amount of his money to persons involved in distributing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, that charity, given to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the greatest charity in the world. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, usually of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), that is a chance to progress by offering worship and respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.23):\n\nOne who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual master, in whom he has similar unflinching faith, can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. One cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by mental speculation. For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nThe personal forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are described as su-durdar\u015bam, very difficult to see. They are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The four-handed form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and the two-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary. The words tvad anyena na d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da-p\u016brvam (verse 47) state that before Arjuna, no one had seen that universal form. Also, they suggest that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the request of Arjuna so that in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.\n\nThe word na, used repeatedly in the previous verse, indicates that one should not be very much proud of such credentials as an academic education in Vedic literature. One must take to the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Only then can one attempt to write commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the origin of all emanations. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is distinct even from these forms, what to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (which is known as Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.48),\n\n\u201cThe Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u, into whom all the innumerable universes enter and from whom they come forth again simply by His breathing process, is a plenary expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore I worship Govinda, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the cause of all causes.\u201d Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who has eternal bliss and knowledge. He is the source of all forms of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\nIn the Vedic literature (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.1) the following statement appears:\n\n\u201cI offer my respectful obeisances unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who has a transcendental form of bliss, eternity and knowledge. I offer my respect to Him, because understanding Him means understanding the Vedas, and He is therefore the supreme spiritual master.\u201d Then it is said, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47o vai parama\u1e41 daivatam: \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.3) Eko va\u015b\u012b sarva-ga\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u012b\u1e0dya\u1e25: \u201cThat one K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is worshipable.\u201d Eko \u2019pi san bahudh\u0101 yo \u2019vabh\u0101ti: \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is one, but He is manifested in unlimited forms and expanded incarnations.\u201d (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.21)\n\nThe Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.1) says,\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who has a body of eternity, knowledge and bliss. He has no beginning, for He is the beginning of everything. He is the cause of all causes.\u201d\n\nElsewhere it is said, yatr\u0101vat\u012br\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101khya\u1e41 para\u1e41 brahma nar\u0101k\u1e5bti: \u201cThe Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, His name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He sometimes descends on this earth.\u201d Similarly, in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam we find a description of all kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in this list the name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also appears. But then it is said that this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself (ete c\u0101\u1e41\u015ba-kal\u0101\u1e25 pu\u1e41sa\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam).\n\nSimilarly, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says, matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat: \u201cThere is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, aham \u0101dir hi dev\u0101n\u0101m: \u201cI am the origin of all the demigods.\u201d And after understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma pavitra\u1e41 parama\u1e41 bhav\u0101n, \u201cI now fully understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of everything.\u201d Therefore the universal form which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed to Arjuna is not the original form of God. The original is the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a form. The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God\u2019s original form.\n\nThe universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who was a constant companion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service the two-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the most dear."}, {"verse": "TEXT 55", "devanagari": "\u092e\u0924\u094d\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0915\u0943\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0924\u094d\u092a\u0930\u092e\u094b \u092e\u0926\u094d\u092d\u200d\u0915\u094d\u0924: \u0938\u0919\u094d\u0917\u0935\u0930\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0924: \u0964\n\u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0948\u0930: \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u092d\u0942\u0924\u0947\u0937\u0941 \u092f: \u0938 \u092e\u093e\u092e\u0947\u0924\u093f \u092a\u093e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0935 \u0965 \u096b\u096b \u0965", "verse-text": "mat-karma-k\u1e5bn mat-paramo\nmad-bhakta\u1e25 sa\u1e45ga-varjita\u1e25\nnirvaira\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u\nya\u1e25 sa m\u0101m eti p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava", "synonyms": "mat-karma-k\u1e5bt \u2014 engaged in doing My work; mat-parama\u1e25 \u2014 considering Me the Supreme; mat-bhakta\u1e25 \u2014 engaged in My devotional service; sa\u1e45ga-varjita\u1e25 \u2014 freed from the contamination of fruitive activities and mental speculation; nirvaira\u1e25 \u2014 without an enemy; sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u \u2014 among all living entities; ya\u1e25 \u2014 one who; sa\u1e25 \u2014 he; m\u0101m \u2014 unto Me; eti \u2014 comes; p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava \u2014 O son of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du.", "translation": "My dear Arjuna, he who engages in My pure devotional service, free from the contaminations of fruitive activities and mental speculation, he who works for Me, who makes Me the supreme goal of his life, and who is friendly to every living being \u2013 he certainly comes to Me.", "purport": "Anyone who wants to approach the supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the Supreme Personality, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, must take this formula, as stated by the Supreme Himself. Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the supreme spiritual personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity: devotional service.\n\nAs far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities. As stated in the Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.255),\n\nNo work should be done by any man except in relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is called k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to the result of his work; the result should be done only for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one has to do business for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of the business, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should enjoy the profit of the business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can do it. This is work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he can install the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and arrange for the Deity\u2019s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service. This is all k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and one should accept as pras\u0101dam the remnants of offerings to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one constructs a very big building for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and installs the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is not prohibited from living there, but it is understood that the proprietor of the building is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that is also k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who has land \u2013 in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land \u2013 can utilize that for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by growing flowers to offer Him. One can sow tulas\u012b plants, because tulas\u012b leaves are very important and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has recommended this in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toyam. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or fruit, or a little water \u2013 and by such an offering He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the tulas\u012b. So one can sow tulas\u012b and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nThe word mat-parama\u1e25 refers to one who considers the association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing brahma-jyotir effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the word mad-bhakta\u1e25, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.\n\nThe term sa\u1e45ga-varjita\u1e25 is very significant. One should disassociate himself from persons who are against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Not only are the atheistic persons against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but so also are those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.1.11) as follows:\n\nIn this verse \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that is called pure devotional service. \u0100nuk\u016blyasya sa\u1e45kalpa\u1e25 pr\u0101tik\u016blyasya varjanam (Hari-bhakti-vil\u0101sa 11.676). One should think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and act for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably, not unfavorably. Ka\u1e41sa was an enemy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s. From the very beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birth, Ka\u1e41sa planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious in every respect, but that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. His only objective is to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wherever he may be.\n\nA devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he has no enemy (nirvaira\u1e25). How is this? A devotee situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness knows that only devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can relieve a person from all the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord who risked their lives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He was crucified by the nondevotees, but he sacrificed his life for spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand that he was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa and Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and it is difficult. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving one\u2019s neighbor from all material problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to those engaged in His service, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.\n\nIn summary, the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is a temporary manifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, four-handed, have all been exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all these manifestations. It is not that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a manifestation of the original vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all forms. There are hundreds and thousands of Vi\u1e63\u1e47us, but for a devotee no form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is important but the original form, two-handed \u015ay\u0101masundara. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that those who are attached to the \u015ay\u0101masundara form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is essential and supreme."}], "desc": ""}, {"name": "Chapter Twelve: Devotional Service", "link": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/12/advanced-view", "verses": [{"verse": "TEXT 1", "devanagari": "\u0905\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0941\u0928 \u0909\u0935\u093e\u091a\n\u090f\u0935\u0902 \u0938\u0924\u0924\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e \u092f\u0947 \u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0941\u092a\u093e\u0938\u0924\u0947 \u0964\n\u092f\u0947 \u091a\u093e\u092a\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u092e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u0924\u0947\u0937\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u092f\u094b\u0917\u0935\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e\u093e: \u0965 \u0967 \u0965", "verse-text": "arjuna uv\u0101ca\neva\u1e41 satata-yukt\u0101 ye\nbhakt\u0101s tv\u0101\u1e41 paryup\u0101sate\nye c\u0101py ak\u1e63aram avyakta\u1e41\nte\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 ke yoga-vittam\u0101\u1e25", "synonyms": "arjuna\u1e25 uv\u0101ca \u2014 Arjuna said; evam \u2014 thus; satata \u2014 always; yukt\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 engaged; ye \u2014 those who; bhakt\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 devotees; tv\u0101m \u2014 You; paryup\u0101sate \u2014 properly worship; ye \u2014 those who; ca \u2014 also; api \u2014 again; ak\u1e63aram \u2014 beyond the senses; avyaktam \u2014 the unmanifested; te\u1e63\u0101m \u2014 of them; ke \u2014 who; yoga-vit-tam\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 the most perfect in knowledge of yoga.", "translation": "Arjuna inquired: Which are considered to be more perfect, those who are always properly engaged in Your devotional service or those who worship the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested?", "purport": "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the universal and has described all kinds of devotees and yog\u012bs. Generally, the transcendentalists can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist, and the other is the personalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the service of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist also engages himself, not directly in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but in meditation on the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested.\n\nWe find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the Absolute Truth, bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the highest. If one at all desires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he must take to devotional service.\n\nThose who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal Brahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning which position is better. There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga, or devotional service to Him, is the highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for association with the Godhead.\n\nIn the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Supreme Lord explained that a living entity is not the material body; he is a spiritual spark. And the Absolute Truth is the spiritual whole. In the Seventh Chapter He spoke of the living entity as being part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommended that he transfer his attention fully to the whole. Then again in the Eighth Chapter it was said that anyone who thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the time of quitting his body is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, to the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And at the end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord clearly said that of all yog\u012bs, one who always thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within himself is considered the most perfect. So in practically every chapter the conclusion has been that one should be attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for that is the highest spiritual realization.\n\nNevertheless, there are those who are not attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They are so firmly detached that even in the preparation of commentaries to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 they want to distract other people from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and transfer all devotion to the impersonal brahma-jyotir. They prefer to meditate on the impersonal form of the Absolute Truth, which is beyond the reach of the senses and is not manifest.\n\nAnd so, factually, there are two classes of transcendentalists. Now Arjuna is trying to settle the question of which process is easier and which of the classes is most perfect. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is not attached to the impersonal Brahman. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the Supreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants to say, \u201cWhat is the use of such a waste of time?\u201d Arjuna experienced in the Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to his love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This important question asked of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by Arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal conceptions of the Absolute Truth."}, {"verse": "TEXT 2", "devanagari": "\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0935\u093e\u091a\n\u092e\u092f\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0935\u0947\u0936\u094d\u092f \u092e\u0928\u094b \u092f\u0947 \u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0928\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e \u0909\u092a\u093e\u0938\u0924\u0947 \u0964\n\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0926\u094d\u0927\u092f\u093e \u092a\u0930\u092f\u094b\u092a\u0947\u0924\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u092e\u0947 \u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0924\u092e\u093e \u092e\u0924\u093e: \u0965 \u0968 \u0965", "verse-text": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\nmayy \u0101ve\u015bya mano ye m\u0101\u1e41\nnitya-yukt\u0101 up\u0101sate\n\u015braddhay\u0101 parayopet\u0101s\nte me yukta-tam\u0101 mat\u0101\u1e25", "synonyms": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca \u2014 the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; mayi \u2014 upon Me; \u0101ve\u015bya \u2014 fixing; mana\u1e25 \u2014 the mind; ye \u2014 those who; m\u0101m \u2014 Me; nitya \u2014 always; yukt\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 engaged; up\u0101sate \u2014 worship; \u015braddhay\u0101 \u2014 with faith; paray\u0101 \u2014 transcendental; upet\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 endowed; te \u2014 they; me \u2014 by Me; yukta-tam\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 most perfect in yoga; mat\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 are considered.", "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Those who fix their minds on My personal form and are always engaged in worshiping Me with great and transcendental faith are considered by Me to be most perfect.", "purport": "In answer to Arjuna\u2019s question, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says that he who concentrates upon His personal form and who worships Him with faith and devotion is to be considered most perfect in yoga.

To make progress in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.", "purport": "The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable, unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012bs, and persons who are in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, engaged in devotional service to the Lord, are called bhakti-yog\u012bs. Now, here the difference between j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga is definitely expressed. The process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path of bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, the bhakti-yog\u012b accepts the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be sagu\u1e47a or nirgu\u1e47a \u2013 of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is sagu\u1e47a worship, for the Lord is represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as stone, wood or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.\n\nA crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the street, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their destination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation which we may find somewhere but which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the work. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which is called arc\u0101-vigraha. This arc\u0101-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord. God will accept service through that form. The Lord is omnipotent, all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arc\u0101-vigraha He can accept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned life.\n\nSo for a devotee there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual realization the path is difficult. They have to understand the unmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the Upani\u1e63ads, and they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and realize all these processes. This is not very easy for a common man. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, without any risk, trouble or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personality directly. A similar passage appears in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. It is stated there that if one ultimately has to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (this surrendering process is called bhakti), but instead takes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply troublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path of self-realization, because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result.\n\nA living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not realized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned in the process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or devotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice and at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independent, and one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual, blissful self. One should not take up this process. For every individual living entity the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which entails full engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore this devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus the process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}, {"verse": "TEXTS 6-7", "devanagari": "\u092f\u0947 \u0924\u0941 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923\u093f \u092e\u092f\u093f \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092e\u0924\u094d\u092a\u0930\u093e: \u0964\n\u0905\u0928\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0928\u0948\u0935 \u092f\u094b\u0917\u0947\u0928 \u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924 \u0909\u092a\u093e\u0938\u0924\u0947 \u0965 \u096c \u0965\n\u0924\u0947\u0937\u093e\u092e\u0939\u0902 \u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093e \u092e\u0943\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0938\u0902\u0938\u093e\u0930\u0938\u093e\u0917\u0930\u093e\u0924\u094d \u0964\n\u092d\u0935\u093e\u092e\u093f \u0928 \u091a\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u092e\u092f\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0935\u0947\u0936\u093f\u0924\u091a\u0947\u0924\u0938\u093e\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u096d \u0965", "verse-text": "ye tu sarv\u0101\u1e47i karm\u0101\u1e47i\nmayi sannyasya mat-par\u0101\u1e25\nananyenaiva yogena\nm\u0101\u1e41 dhy\u0101yanta up\u0101sate\n\nte\u1e63\u0101m aha\u1e41 samuddhart\u0101\nm\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-s\u0101gar\u0101t\nbhav\u0101mi na cir\u0101t p\u0101rtha\nmayy \u0101ve\u015bita-cetas\u0101m", "synonyms": "ye \u2014 those who; tu \u2014 but; sarv\u0101\u1e47i \u2014 all; karm\u0101\u1e47i \u2014 activities; mayi \u2014 unto Me; sannyasya \u2014 giving up; mat-par\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 being attached to Me; ananyena \u2014 without division; eva \u2014 certainly; yogena \u2014 by practice of such bhakti-yoga; m\u0101m \u2014 upon Me; dhy\u0101yanta\u1e25 \u2014 meditating; up\u0101sate \u2014 worship; te\u1e63\u0101m \u2014 of them; aham \u2014 I; samuddhart\u0101 \u2014 the deliverer; m\u1e5btyu \u2014 of death; sa\u1e41s\u0101ra \u2014 in material existence; s\u0101gar\u0101t \u2014 from the ocean; bhav\u0101mi \u2014 I become; na \u2014 not; cir\u0101t \u2014 after a long time; p\u0101rtha \u2014 O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; mayi \u2014 upon Me; \u0101ve\u015bita \u2014 fixed; cetas\u0101m \u2014 of those whose minds.", "translation": "But those who worship Me, giving up all their activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, having fixed their minds upon Me, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101 \u2013 for them I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death.", "purport": "It is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be delivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devotional service one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual soul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord \u2013 and if he does not, then he will render service to m\u0101y\u0101.\n\nAs stated before, the Supreme Lord can be appreciated only by devotional service. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in order to achieve Him. One should work only for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It does not matter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not desire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His life\u2019s mission is to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he can sacrifice everything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. The process is very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at the same time in chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to the Personality of Godhead.\n\nThe Supreme Lord herein promises that without delay He will deliver a pure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who are advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet they like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways, but as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord Himself takes him. The devotee does not need to wait to become very experienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky.\n\nIn the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a this verse appears:\n\nThe purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The responsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here that He Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his parents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the Supreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier Garu\u1e0da, and at once delivers the devotee from material existence. Although a man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert in swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks him up from the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up the devotee from this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service. Any intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all other paths. In the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u012bya this is confirmed as follows:\n\nThe purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative process. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the benefits derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacrifices, charities, etc. That is the specific benediction of devotional service.\n\nSimply by chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2013 a devotee of the Lord can approach the supreme destination easily and happily, but this destination cannot be approached by any other process of religion.\n\nThe conclusion of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter:\n\nOne should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That will enable one to reach the highest perfection of life. There is no need for one to consider the sinful actions of his past life, because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him. Therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual realization. Let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

For this second class there are different prescribed rules and regulations one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nBhakti-yoga is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in material existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense gratification. But by the practice of bhakti-yoga these senses can become purified, and in the purified state they come directly in contact with the Supreme Lord. In this material existence, I may be engaged in some service to some master, but I don\u2019t really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get some money. And the master also is not in love; he takes service from me and pays me. So there is no question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be elevated to the pure stage of love. That stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service, performed with the present senses.\n\nThis love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone\u2019s heart. And, there, love of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by material association. Now the heart has to be purified of the material association, and that dormant, natural love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has to be revived. That is the whole process.\n\nTo practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga one should, under the guidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should rise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to offer to the Deity, take pras\u0101dam, and so on.

The only difference is that in materialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be performed for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that is spiritual activity. If one has sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for propagating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Or he can help with publications.

For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such procedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of sacrifices and special functions for the full-moon day, and there is special work in which the result of one\u2019s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become elevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not even interested in the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness gives charity to some hospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving up the fruits of one\u2019s activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Of course, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not dependent on any other experience, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness itself can purify one\u2019s mind, but if there are impediments to accepting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one may try to give up the results of his actions. In that respect, social service, community service, national service, sacrifice for one\u2019s country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord.

For those who are actually not able to follow the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness it is better to cultivate knowledge, because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position. Gradually knowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation one can be able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a gradual process. In the cultivation of knowledge there are processes which make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional service. If one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras, which we shall find in the last chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. But in all cases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ the result of karma for some good cause.\n\nIn summary, to reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process is by gradual development, and the other process is direct. Devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the direct method, and the other method involves renouncing the fruits of one\u2019s activities. Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One may take either the step-by-step process or the direct path. The direct process is not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It is, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna, because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord. It is for others, who are not at this stage; for them the gradual process of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and Brahman should be followed. But as far as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is concerned, it is the direct method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the direct method and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}, {"verse": "TEXTS 13-14", "devanagari": "\u0905\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u092d\u0942\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u092e\u0948\u0924\u094d\u0930: \u0915\u0930\u0941\u0923 \u090f\u0935 \u091a \u0964\n\u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092e\u092e\u094b \u0928\u093f\u0930\u0939\u0919\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930: \u0938\u092e\u0926\u0941:\u0916\u0938\u0941\u0916: \u0915\u094d\u0937\u092e\u0940 \u0965 \u0967\u0969 \u0965\n\u0938\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0937\u094d\u091f: \u0938\u0924\u0924\u0902 \u092f\u094b\u0917\u0940 \u092f\u0924\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e \u0926\u0943\u0922\u0928\u093f\u0936\u094d\u091a\u092f: \u0964\n\u092e\u092f\u094d\u092f\u0930\u094d\u092a\u093f\u0924\u092e\u0928\u094b\u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b \u092e\u0926\u094d\u092d\u200d\u0915\u094d\u0924: \u0938 \u092e\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f: \u0965 \u0967\u096a \u0965", "verse-text": "adve\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\nmaitra\u1e25 karu\u1e47a eva ca\nnirmamo niraha\u1e45k\u0101ra\u1e25\nsama-du\u1e25kha-sukha\u1e25 k\u1e63am\u012b\n\nsantu\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 satata\u1e41 yog\u012b\nyat\u0101tm\u0101 d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-ni\u015bcaya\u1e25\nmayy arpita-mano-buddhir\nyo mad-bhakta\u1e25 sa me priya\u1e25", "synonyms": "adve\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 \u2014 nonenvious; sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m \u2014 toward all living entities; maitra\u1e25 \u2014 friendly; karu\u1e47a\u1e25 \u2014 kindly; eva \u2014 certainly; ca \u2014 also; nirmama\u1e25 \u2014 with no sense of proprietorship; niraha\u1e45k\u0101ra\u1e25 \u2014 without false ego; sama \u2014 equal; du\u1e25kha \u2014 in distress; sukha\u1e25 \u2014 and happiness; k\u1e63am\u012b \u2014 forgiving; santu\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 \u2014 satisfied; satatam \u2014 always; yog\u012b \u2014 one engaged in devotion; yata-\u0101tm\u0101 \u2014 self-controlled; d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-ni\u015bcaya\u1e25 \u2014 with determination; mayi \u2014 upon Me; arpita \u2014 engaged; mana\u1e25 \u2014 mind; buddhi\u1e25 \u2014 and intelligence; ya\u1e25 \u2014 one who; mat-bhakta\u1e25 \u2014 My devotee; sa\u1e25 \u2014 he; me \u2014 to Me; priya\u1e25 \u2014 dear.", "translation": "One who is not envious but is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor and is free from false ego, who is equal in both happiness and distress, who is tolerant, always satisfied, self-controlled, and engaged in devotional service with determination, his mind and intelligence fixed on Me \u2013 such a devotee of Mine is very dear to Me.", "purport": "Coming again to the point of pure devotional service, the Lord is describing the transcendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses. A pure devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone. Nor does a devotee become his enemy\u2019s enemy; he thinks, \u201cThis person is acting as my enemy due to my own past misdeeds. So it is better to suffer than to protest.\u201d In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.8) it is stated: tat te \u2019nukamp\u0101\u1e41 su-sam\u012bk\u1e63am\u0101\u1e47o bhu\u00f1j\u0101na ev\u0101tma-k\u1e5bta\u1e41 vip\u0101kam. Whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that it is the Lord\u2019s mercy upon him. He thinks, \u201cThanks to my past misdeeds I should suffer far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the mercy of the Supreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due. I am just getting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d Therefore he is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many distressful conditions. A devotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his enemy. Nirmama means that a devotee does not attach much importance to the pains and trouble pertaining to the body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body. He does not identify with the body; therefore he is freed from the conception of false ego and is equipoised in happiness and distress. He is tolerant, and he is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor much to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is always joyful. He is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the instructions received from the spiritual master, and because his senses are controlled he is determined. He is not swayed by false arguments, because no one can lead him from the fixed determination of devotional service. He is fully conscious that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All these qualifications enable him to fix his mind and intelligence entirely on the Supreme Lord. Such a standard of devotional service is undoubtedly very rare, but a devotee becomes situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of devotional service. Furthermore, the Lord says that such a devotee is very dear to Him, for the Lord is always pleased with all his activities in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}, {"verse": "TEXT 15", "devanagari": "\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0928\u094b\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u091c\u0924\u0947 \u0932\u094b\u0915\u094b \u0932\u094b\u0915\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0928\u094b\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u091c\u0924\u0947 \u091a \u092f: \u0964\n\u0939\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093e\u092e\u0930\u094d\u0937\u092d\u092f\u094b\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0917\u0948\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094b \u092f: \u0938 \u091a \u092e\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f: \u0965 \u0967\u096b \u0965", "verse-text": "yasm\u0101n nodvijate loko\nlok\u0101n nodvijate ca ya\u1e25\nhar\u1e63\u0101mar\u1e63a-bhayodvegair\nmukto ya\u1e25 sa ca me priya\u1e25", "synonyms": "yasm\u0101t \u2014 from whom; na \u2014 never; udvijate \u2014 are agitated; loka\u1e25 \u2014 people; lok\u0101t \u2014 from people; na \u2014 never; udvijate \u2014 is disturbed; ca \u2014 also; ya\u1e25 \u2014 anyone who; har\u1e63a \u2014 from happiness; amar\u1e63a \u2014 distress; bhaya \u2014 fear; udvegai\u1e25 \u2014 and anxiety; mukta\u1e25 \u2014 freed; ya\u1e25 \u2014 who; sa\u1e25 \u2014 anyone; ca \u2014 also; me \u2014 to Me; priya\u1e25 \u2014 very dear.", "translation": "He by whom no one is put into difficulty and who is not disturbed by anyone, who is equipoised in happiness and distress, fear and anxiety, is very dear to Me.", "purport": "A few of a devotee\u2019s qualifications are further being described.

Actually because a devotee is always engrossed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and engaged in devotional service, such material circumstances cannot move him. Generally a materialistic person becomes very happy when there is something for his sense gratification and his body, but when he sees that others have something for their sense gratification and he hasn\u2019t, he is sorry and envious. When he is expecting some retaliation from an enemy, he is in a state of fear, and when he cannot successfully execute something he becomes dejected.

Such processes are very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person engaged in them. The question of who is better \u2013 one who is engaged in the path of impersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2013 was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of Godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words, in this chapter it is decided that through good association one develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is recommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception may be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step-by-step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in the middle six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is more congenial.

Therefore the body is called k\u1e63etra, or the field of activity for the conditioned soul. Now, the person, who should not identify himself with the body, is called k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a, the knower of the field. It is not very difficult to understand the difference between the field and its knower, the body and the knower of the body. Any person can consider that from childhood to old age he undergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person, remaining. Thus there is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and the actual field of activities. A living conditioned soul can thus understand that he is different from the body. It is described in the beginning \u2013 dehino \u2019smin \u2013 that the living entity is within the body and that the body is changing from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and from youth to old age, and the person who owns the body knows that the body is changing. The owner is distinctly k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a. Sometimes we think, \u201cI am happy,\u201d \u201cI am a man,\u201d \u201cI am a woman,\u201d \u201cI am a dog,\u201d \u201cI am a cat.\u201d These are the bodily designations of the knower. But the knower is different from the body. Although we may use many articles \u2013 our clothes, etc. \u2013 we know that we are different from the things used. Similarly, we also understand by a little contemplation that we are different from the body. I or you or anyone else who owns the body is called k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a, the knower of the field of activities, and the body is called k\u1e63etra, the field of activities itself.\n\nIn the first six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the knower of the body (the living entity) and the position by which he can understand the Supreme Lord are described. In the middle six chapters of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the relationship between the individual soul and the Supersoul in regard to devotional service are described. The superior position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the subordinate position of the individual soul are definitely defined in these chapters. The living entities are subordinate under all circumstances, but in their forgetfulness they are suffering. When enlightened by pious activities, they approach the Supreme Lord in different capacities \u2013 as the distressed, those in want of money, the inquisitive, and those in search of knowledge. That is also described. Now, starting with the Thirteenth Chapter, how the living entity comes into contact with material nature and how he is delivered by the Supreme Lord through the different methods of fruitive activities, cultivation of knowledge, and the discharge of devotional service are explained. Although the living entity is completely different from the material body, he somehow becomes related. This also is explained."}, {"verse": "TEXT 3", "devanagari": "\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0902 \u091a\u093e\u092a\u093f \u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0937\u0941 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0964\n\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091e\u092f\u094b\u0930\u094d\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u092f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u092e\u0924\u0902 \u092e\u092e \u0965 \u0969 \u0965", "verse-text": "k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a\u1e41 c\u0101pi m\u0101\u1e41 viddhi\nsarva-k\u1e63etre\u1e63u bh\u0101rata\nk\u1e63etra-k\u1e63etraj\u00f1ayor j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41\nyat taj j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 mata\u1e41 mama", "synonyms": "k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1am \u2014 the knower of the field; ca \u2014 also; api \u2014 certainly; m\u0101m \u2014 Me; viddhi \u2014 know; sarva \u2014 all; k\u1e63etre\u1e63u \u2014 in bodily fields; bh\u0101rata \u2014 O son of Bharata; k\u1e63etra \u2014 the field of activities (the body); k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1ayo\u1e25 \u2014 and the knower of the field; j\u00f1\u0101nam \u2014 knowledge of; yat \u2014 that which; tat \u2014 that; j\u00f1\u0101nam \u2014 knowledge; matam \u2014 opinion; mama \u2014 My.", "translation": "O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies, and to understand this body and its knower is called knowledge. That is My opinion.", "purport": "While discussing the subject of the body and the knower of the body, the soul and the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the Lord, the living entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cI am also the knower, but I am not the individual knower of the body. I am the superknower. I am present in every body as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul.\u201d\n\nOne who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of the field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, can attain to knowledge.\n\nThe Lord says, \u201cI am the knower of the field of activities in every individual body.\u201d The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in knowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the different bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may know everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one may be the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the citizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme proprietor of all bodies.\n\nThe body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, which means \u201cthe controller of the senses.\u201d He is the original controller of the senses, just as the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state; the citizens are secondary controllers. The Lord says, \u201cI am also the knower.\u201d This means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his particular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:\n\nThis body is called the k\u1e63etra, and within it dwells the owner of the body and the Supreme Lord, who knows both the body and the owner of the body. Therefore He is called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the field of activities, the knower of activities, and the supreme knower of activities is described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as j\u00f1\u0101na. That is the opinion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. To understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of prak\u1e5bti (nature), puru\u1e63a (the enjoyer of nature) and \u012b\u015bvara (the knower who dominates or controls nature and the individual soul). One should not confuse the three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting and the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic language (in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 1.12), bhokt\u0101 bhogya\u1e41 prerit\u0101ra\u1e41 ca matv\u0101/ sarva\u1e41 prokta\u1e41 tri-vidha\u1e41 brahmam etat. There are three Brahman conceptions: prak\u1e5bti is Brahman as the field of activities, and the j\u012bva (individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller.\n\nIn this chapter it will also be explained that out of the two knowers, one is fallible and the other is infallible. One is superior and the other is subordinate. One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who states here very clearly, \u201cI am also the knower of the field of activity.\u201d One who misunderstands a rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies, and there are different owners of the bodies. Because each individual soul has his individual capacity for lording it over material nature, there are different bodies. But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller. The word ca is significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. That is the opinion of \u015ar\u012bla Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supersoul present in each and every body apart from the individual soul. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explicitly says here that real knowledge is to know that the Supersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite enjoyer."}, {"verse": "TEXT 4", "devanagari": "\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u092f\u091a\u094d\u091a\u200d \u092f\u093e\u0926\u0943\u0915\u094d\u200d\u091a \u092f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0930\u093f \u092f\u0924\u0936\u094d\u091a \u092f\u0924\u094d \u0964\n\u0938 \u091a \u092f\u094b \u092f\u0924\u094d\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0936\u094d\u091a \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0938\u092e\u093e\u0938\u0947\u0928 \u092e\u0947 \u0936\u200d\u0943\u0923\u0941 \u0965 \u096a \u0965", "verse-text": "tat k\u1e63etra\u1e41 yac ca y\u0101d\u1e5bk ca\nyad-vik\u0101ri yata\u015b ca yat\nsa ca yo yat-prabh\u0101va\u015b ca\ntat sam\u0101sena me \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u", "synonyms": "tat \u2014 that; k\u1e63etram \u2014 field of activities; yat \u2014 what; ca \u2014 also; y\u0101d\u1e5bk \u2014 as it is; ca \u2014 also; yat \u2014 having what; vik\u0101ri \u2014 changes; yata\u1e25 \u2014 from which; ca \u2014 also; yat \u2014 what; sa\u1e25 \u2014 he; ca \u2014 also; ya\u1e25 \u2014 who; yat \u2014 having what; prabh\u0101va\u1e25 \u2014 influence; ca \u2014 also; tat \u2014 that; sam\u0101sena \u2014 in summary; me \u2014 from Me; \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u \u2014 understand.", "translation": "Now please hear My brief description of this field of activity and how it is constituted, what its changes are, whence it is produced, who that knower of the field of activities is, and what his influences are.", "purport": "The Lord is describing the field of activities and the knower of the field of activities in their constitutional positions.

Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and nonduality of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to a scripture, the Ved\u0101nta, which is accepted as authority. First He says, \u201cThis is according to different sages.\u201d As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vy\u0101sadeva (the author of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra) is a great sage, and in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra duality is perfectly explained. And Vy\u0101sadeva\u2019s father, Par\u0101\u015bara, is also a great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity, aham tva\u1e41 ca tath\u0101nye.\u2026 \u201cwe \u2013 you, I and the various other living entities \u2013 are all transcendental, although in material bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different karma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental.\u201d Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad. There are many great sages who have explained this, and Par\u0101\u015bara is considered principal among them.\n\nThe word chandobhi\u1e25 refers to the various Vedic literatures. The Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad, for example, which is a branch of the Yajur Veda, describes nature, the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\nAs stated before, k\u1e63etra is the field of activities, and there are two kinds of k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a: the individual living entity and the supreme living entity. As stated in the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad (2.5), brahma puccha\u1e41 prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101. There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord\u2019s energy known as anna-maya, dependence upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme. Then, in pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya, after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in food, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms or life forms. In j\u00f1\u0101na-maya, realization extends beyond the living symptoms to the point of thinking, feeling and willing. Then there is Brahman realization, called vij\u00f1\u0101na-maya, in which the living entity\u2019s mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme stage is \u0101nanda-maya, realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five stages of Brahman realization, which are called brahma puccham. Out of these, the first three \u2013 anna-maya, pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya and j\u00f1\u0101na-maya \u2013 involve the fields of activities of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called \u0101nanda-maya. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra also describes the Supreme by saying, \u0101nanda-mayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy. To enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into vij\u00f1\u0101na-maya, pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya, j\u00f1\u0101na-maya and anna-maya. In the field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the \u0101nanda-maya. That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy in dovetailing himself with the \u0101nanda-maya, then he becomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord as the supreme knower of the field, the living entity as the subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities.

First there are earth, water, fire, air and ether. These are the five great elements (mah\u0101-bh\u016bta). Then there are false ego, intelligence and the unmanifested stage of the three modes of nature. Then there are five senses for acquiring knowledge: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. Then five working senses: voice, legs, hands, anus and genitals. Then, above the senses, there is the mind, which is within and which can be called the sense within. Therefore, including the mind, there are eleven senses altogether. Then there are the five objects of the senses: smell, taste, form, touch and sound. Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements is called the field of activity. If one makes an analytical study of these twenty-four subjects, then he can very well understand the field of activity. Then there are desire, hatred, happiness and distress, which are interactions, representations of the five great elements in the gross body. The living symptoms, represented by consciousness, and convictions are the manifestation of the subtle body \u2013 mind, ego and intelligence. These subtle elements are included within the field of activities.\n\nThe five great elements are a gross representation of the false ego, which in turn represents the primal stage of false ego technically called the materialistic conception, or t\u0101masa-buddhi, intelligence in ignorance. This, further, represents the unmanifested stage of the three modes of material nature. The unmanifested modes of material nature are called pradh\u0101na.\n\nOne who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along with their interactions should study the philosophy in more detail. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, a summary only is given.\n\nThe body is the representation of all these factors, and there are changes of the body, which are six in number: the body is born, it grows, it stays, it produces by-products, then it begins to decay, and at the last stage it vanishes. Therefore the field is a nonpermanent material thing.

But actually this is the real process of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility of approaching the Absolute Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the twenty-four elements, as described before. This is actually the means to get out of the entanglement of those elements. The embodied soul is entrapped by the body, which is a casing made of the twenty-four elements, and the process of knowledge as described here is the means to get out of it. Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important point is described in the first line of the eleventh verse. Mayi c\u0101nanya-yogena bhaktir avyabhic\u0101ri\u1e47\u012b: the process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. So if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value. But if one takes to devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the other nineteen items automatically develop within him. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.18.12), yasy\u0101sti bhaktir bhagavaty aki\u00f1can\u0101 sarvair gu\u1e47ais tatra sam\u0101sate sur\u0101\u1e25. All the good qualities of knowledge develop in one who has attained the stage of devotional service. The principle of accepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the eighth verse, is essential. Even for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important. Transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path. Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense.\n\nAs for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows. Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge \u2013 who knows that he is not this body \u2013 anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after this material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of religion one enters into some group which is not actually following religious principles and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor. As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items.\n\nNonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, but actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in general are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they perpetually suffer material pains. So unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge, one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real knowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material entanglement. That is nonviolence.\n\nTolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected because material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahl\u0101da, who, only five years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father tried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahl\u0101da tolerated him. So there may be many impediments to making advancement in spiritual knowledge, but we should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.\n\nSimplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the spiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a bona fide spiritual master is a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced without the disciple\u2019s following the regulative principles. Or, the regulative principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without reservation.\n\nCleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are two kinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means taking a bath, but for internal cleanliness one has to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind.\n\nSteadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in spiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress. And self-control means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed to this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This is real renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not necessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That will control the eyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the nose in smelling the flowers offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the process of devotional service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is simply expounding the science of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole objective. Unintelligent commentators on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 try to divert the mind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 than devotional service.\n\nFalse ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that he is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego. Ego is there. False ego is condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature (B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad 1.4.10) it is said, aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi: I am Brahman, I am spirit. This \u201cI am,\u201d the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This sense of \u201cI am\u201d is ego, but when the sense of \u201cI am\u201d is applied to this false body it is false ego. When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego. There are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego, because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up the false identification with the body.\n\nOne should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam the world of the unborn, the child\u2019s stay in the womb of the mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be thoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any solution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the authoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be diseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these. Unless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making advancement in spiritual life.\n\nAs for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one should have no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection. But when they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to them. The best process for making the home pleasant is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he can make his home very happy, because this process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is very easy. One need only chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and engage oneself in Deity worship. These four things will make one happy. One should train the members of his family in this way. The family members can sit down morning and evening and chant together Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no need to change from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial, not favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned. One must sacrifice everything to realize or serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, just as Arjuna did. Arjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that these family members were impediments to his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a realization, he accepted the instruction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be detached from the happiness and distress of family life, because in this world one can never be fully happy or fully miserable.\n\nHappiness and distress are concomitant factors of material life. One should learn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be automatically equipoised in both cases. Generally, when we get something desirable we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable we are distressed. But if we are actually in the spiritual position these things will not agitate us. To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional service. Devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional service \u2013 chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc. \u2013 as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter. That process should be followed.\n\nNaturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men. That would go against his grain. One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place, without unwanted association. Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a waste of time. There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 such research work and philosophical speculation have no value. That is more or less nonsensical. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one should make research, by philosophical discretion, into the nature of the soul. One should make research to understand the self. That is recommended here.\n\nAs far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that bhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion, one must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual soul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the bhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. This service of the individual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as it is clearly stated. So bhakti, or devotional service, is eternal. One should be established in that philosophical conviction.\n\nIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.11) this is explained. Vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattva\u1e41 yaj j\u00f1\u0101nam advayam. \u201cThose who are actually knowers of the Absolute Truth know that the Self is realized in three different phases, as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d Bhagav\u0101n is the last word in the realization of the Absolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of the Lord. That is the perfection of knowledge.\n\nBeginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a staircase beginning from the ground floor and going up to the top floor. Now on this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the second or the third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is the understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone wants to compete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that without humility, understanding is not truly possible. To think oneself God is most puffed up. Although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, he still thinks, \u201cI am God\u201d because of ignorance. The beginning of knowledge, therefore, is am\u0101nitva, humility. One should be humble and know that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord, one becomes subordinate to material nature. One must know and be convinced of this truth."}, {"verse": "TEXT 13", "devanagari": "\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0947\u092f\u0902 \u092f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094d\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u093f \u092f\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092e\u0943\u0924\u092e\u0936\u094d\u0928\u200d\u0941\u0924\u0947 \u0964\n\u0905\u0928\u093e\u0926\u093f\u092e\u0924\u094d\u092a\u0930\u0902 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e \u0928 \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0938\u0926\u0941\u091a\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0965 \u0967\u0969 \u0965", "verse-text": "j\u00f1eya\u1e41 yat tat pravak\u1e63y\u0101mi\nyaj j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101m\u1e5btam a\u015bnute\nan\u0101di mat-para\u1e41 brahma\nna sat tan n\u0101sad ucyate", "synonyms": "j\u00f1eyam \u2014 the knowable; yat \u2014 which; tat \u2014 that; pravak\u1e63y\u0101mi \u2014 I shall now explain; yat \u2014 which; j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 \u2014 knowing; am\u1e5btam \u2014 nectar; a\u015bnute \u2014 one tastes; an\u0101di \u2014 beginningless; mat-param \u2014 subordinate to Me; brahma \u2014 spirit; na \u2014 neither; sat \u2014 cause; tat \u2014 that; na \u2014 nor; asat \u2014 effect; ucyate \u2014 is said to be.", "translation": "I shall now explain the knowable, knowing which you will taste the eternal.

He has also explained the process of knowing the knower of the field of activities. Now He begins to explain the knowable, first the soul and then the Supersoul. By knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one can relish the nectar of life. As explained in the Second Chapter, the living entity is eternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which the j\u012bva was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of the j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101\u2019s manifestation from the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The Vedic literature confirms this: na j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101 vipa\u015bcit (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 1.2.18). The knower of the body is never born and never dies, and he is full of knowledge.\n\nThe Supreme Lord as the Supersoul is also stated in the Vedic literature (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.16) to be pradh\u0101na-k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a-patir gu\u1e47e\u015ba\u1e25, the chief knower of the body and the master of the three modes of material nature.

This is also confirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teachings. Therefore the description of Brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to the individual soul, and when the word Brahman is applied to the living entity, it is to be understood that he is vij\u00f1\u0101na-brahma as opposed to \u0101nanda-brahma. \u0100nanda-brahma is the Supreme Brahman Personality of Godhead."}, {"verse": "TEXT 14", "devanagari": "\u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0924: \u092a\u093e\u0923\u093f\u092a\u093e\u0926\u0902 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0924\u094b\u093d\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0936\u093f\u0930\u094b\u092e\u0941\u0916\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0924:\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0924\u093f\u092e\u0932\u094d\u0932\u200d\u094b\u0915\u0947 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u092e\u093e\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u092f \u0924\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0924\u093f \u0965 \u0967\u096a \u0965", "verse-text": "sarvata\u1e25 p\u0101\u1e47i-p\u0101da\u1e41 tat\nsarvato \u2019k\u1e63i-\u015biro-mukham\nsarvata\u1e25 \u015brutimal loke\nsarvam \u0101v\u1e5btya ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati", "synonyms": "sarvata\u1e25 \u2014 everywhere; p\u0101\u1e47i \u2014 hands; p\u0101dam \u2014 legs; tat \u2014 that; sarvata\u1e25 \u2014 everywhere; ak\u1e63i \u2014 eyes; \u015bira\u1e25 \u2014 heads; mukham \u2014 faces; sarvata\u1e25 \u2014 everywhere; \u015bruti-mat \u2014 having ears; loke \u2014 in the world; sarvam \u2014 everything; \u0101v\u1e5btya \u2014 covering; ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati \u2014 exists.", "translation": "Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes, heads and faces, and He has ears everywhere.

There are unlimited heads, legs, hands and eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the Supersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul, however, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That is not possible. If he thinks that under ignorance he is not conscious that his hands and legs are diffused all over but when he attains to proper knowledge he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means that the individual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not supreme. The Supreme is different from the individual soul. The Supreme Lord can extend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He accepts it. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is the omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode, far, far away from earth, He can extend His hand to accept what anyone offers. That is His potency.

Actually, the individual souls have spiritual senses, but in conditioned life they are covered with the material elements, and therefore the sense activities are exhibited through matter. The Supreme Lord\u2019s senses are not so covered. His senses are transcendental and are therefore called nirgu\u1e47a. Gu\u1e47a means the material modes, but His senses are without material covering. It should be understood that His senses are not exactly like ours. Although He is the source of all our sensory activities, He has His transcendental senses, which are uncontaminated. This is very nicely explained in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.19) in the verse ap\u0101\u1e47i-p\u0101do javano grah\u012bt\u0101. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated, but He has His hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is the distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no material eyes, but He has eyes \u2013 otherwise how could He see? He sees everything \u2013 past, present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He knows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting us in the future. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: He knows everything, but no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words, the Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these things. But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature.\n\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by His internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy, because He is the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature we find that His whole embodiment is spiritual. He has His eternal form, called sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha. He is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor of all wealth and the owner of all energy. He is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge. These are some of the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the maintainer of all living entities and the witness of all activity. As far as we can understand from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord is always transcendental. Although we do not see His head, face, hands or legs, He has them, and when we are elevated to the transcendental situation we can see the Lord\u2019s form. Due to materially contaminated senses, we cannot see His form.

It is confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 that the devotee who has developed love for the Supreme God can see Him always, without cessation.

In the material world that brahma-jyotir, the Lord\u2019s spiritual effulgence, is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material elements; therefore in this material world we require the assistance of sun, moon, electricity, etc., for light. But in the spiritual world there is no need of such things. It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His luminous effulgence, everything is illuminated. It is clear, therefore, that His situation is not in the material world. He is situated in the spiritual world, which is far, far away in the spiritual sky. That is also confirmed in the Vedic literature. \u0100ditya-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tamasa\u1e25 parast\u0101t (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 3.8). He is just like the sun, eternally luminous, but He is far, far beyond the darkness of this material world.\n\nHis knowledge is transcendental. The Vedic literature confirms that Brahman is concentrated transcendental knowledge. To one who is anxious to be transferred to that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord, who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart. One Vedic mantra (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.18) says, ta\u1e41 ha devam \u0101tma-buddhi-prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e41 mumuk\u1e63ur vai \u015bara\u1e47am aha\u1e41 prapadye. One must surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he at all wants liberation.

The Supreme has legs and hands distributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the individual soul. Therefore that there are two knowers of the field of activity \u2013 the individual soul and the Supersoul \u2013 must be admitted. One\u2019s hands and legs are distributed locally, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hands and legs are distributed everywhere. This is confirmed in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.17): sarvasya prabhum \u012b\u015b\u0101na\u1e41 sarvasya \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 b\u1e5bhat.

This knowledge is of three things: the knower, the knowable and the process of knowing. Combined, these are called vij\u00f1\u0101na, or the science of knowledge. Perfect knowledge can be understood by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord directly. Others are unable to understand. The monists say that at the ultimate stage these three items become one, but the devotees do not accept this. Knowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon as we transfer all consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities and realize that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everything, then we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is nothing but the preliminary stage of understanding devotional service perfectly. In the Fifteenth Chapter this will be very clearly explained.\n\nNow, to summarize, one may understand that verses 6 and 7, beginning from mah\u0101-bh\u016bt\u0101ni and continuing through cetan\u0101 dh\u1e5bti\u1e25, analyze the material elements and certain manifestations of the symptoms of life. These combine to form the body, or the field of activities. And verses 8 through 12, from am\u0101nitvam through tattva-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha-dar\u015banam, describe the process of knowledge for understanding both types of knower of the field of activities, namely the soul and the Supersoul. Then verses 13 through 18, beginning from an\u0101di mat-param and continuing through h\u1e5bdi sarvasya vi\u1e63\u1e6dhitam, describe the soul and the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul.\n\nThus three items have been described: the field of activity (the body), the process of understanding, and both the soul and the Supersoul. It is especially described here that only the unalloyed devotees of the Lord can understand these three items clearly. So for these devotees Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is fully useful; it is they who can attain the supreme goal, the nature of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

The body is the field of activity and is composed of material nature. The individual soul that is embodied and enjoying the activities of the body is the puru\u1e63a, or the living entity.

Of course, it is to be understood that both the Supersoul and the individual entity are different manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entity is in the category of His energy, and the Supersoul is in the category of His personal expansion.\n\nBoth material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say that they existed before the creation. The material manifestation is from the energy of the Supreme Lord, and so also are the living entities, but the living entities are of the superior energy. Both the living entities and material nature existed before this cosmos was manifested. Material nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of the mahat-tattva. Similarly, the living entities are also in Him, and because they are conditioned, they are averse to serving the Supreme Lord. Thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. But with the coming forth of material nature these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material world and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world. That is the mystery of this material creation. Actually the living entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but due to his rebellious nature, he is conditioned within material nature. It really does not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact with material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and why this actually took place. In the scriptures the Lord says that those attracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence. But we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses that all transformations and influences of material nature by the three modes are also productions of material nature.

There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and these varieties are creations of the material nature. They arise from the different sensual pleasures of the living entity, who thus desires to live in this body or that. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of happiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body, and not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of enjoyment; therefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it over material nature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there is no such thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world everyone is struggling hard to acquire different kinds of pleasures for the body. It might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses. The senses are instruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum total \u2013 body and instrument senses \u2013 is offered by material nature, and as will be clear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past desire and activity. According to one\u2019s desires and activities, material nature places one in various residential quarters. The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering. Once placed in some particular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body, being matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At that time, the living entity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity is put into the body of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog. He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog, then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living entity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act according to his body. This is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the individual soul.

It is explained in the Second Chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material existence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the influence of material nature.\n\nHow he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to association with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore, above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental position. That is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Unless one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he has to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing from authoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the science of God from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing process, will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and gradually and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he comes to enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic mantra it is said that as he becomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he proportionately relishes his eternal blissful life."}, {"verse": "TEXT 23", "devanagari": "\u0909\u092a\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0928\u0941\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093e \u091a \u092d\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093e \u092d\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e \u092e\u0939\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930: \u0964\n\u092a\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0947\u0924\u093f \u091a\u093e\u092a\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094b \u0926\u0947\u0939\u0947\u093d\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0928\u094d\u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937: \u092a\u0930: \u0965 \u0968\u0969 \u0965", "verse-text": "upadra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101numant\u0101 ca\nbhart\u0101 bhokt\u0101 mahe\u015bvara\u1e25\nparam\u0101tmeti c\u0101py ukto\ndehe \u2019smin puru\u1e63a\u1e25 para\u1e25", "synonyms": "upadra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 \u2014 overseer; anumant\u0101 \u2014 permitter; ca \u2014 also; bhart\u0101 \u2014 master; bhokt\u0101 \u2014 supreme enjoyer; mah\u0101-\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 \u2014 the Supreme Lord; parama-\u0101tm\u0101 \u2014 the Supersoul; iti \u2014 also; ca \u2014 and; api \u2014 indeed; ukta\u1e25 \u2014 is said; dehe \u2014 in the body; asmin \u2014 this; puru\u1e63a\u1e25 \u2014 enjoyer; para\u1e25 \u2014 transcendental.", "translation": "Yet in this body there is another, a transcendental enjoyer, who is the Lord, the supreme proprietor, who exists as the overseer and permitter, and who is known as the Supersoul.", "purport": "It is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual soul, is the representation of the Supreme Lord. He is not an ordinary living entity. Because the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one, they think that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul. To clarify this, the Lord says that He is represented as the Param\u0101tm\u0101 in every body. He is different from the individual soul; He is para, transcendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field, but the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in bodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer. His name is Param\u0101tm\u0101, not \u0101tm\u0101, and He is transcendental. It is distinctly clear that the \u0101tm\u0101 and Param\u0101tm\u0101 are different. The Supersoul, the Param\u0101tm\u0101, has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not. And because the Param\u0101tm\u0101 is the Supreme Lord, He is present within to sanction the individual soul\u2019s desiring material enjoyment. Without the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the individual soul cannot do anything. The individual is bhukta, or the sustained, and the Lord is bhokt\u0101, or the maintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and He is staying in them as a friend.\n\nThe fact is that every individual living entity is eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But the living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord and act independently in an attempt to dominate nature, and because he has this tendency he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The living entity can be situated either in the material energy or in the spiritual energy. As long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord, as his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the spiritual energy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual energy, but due to his minute independence the individual entity is continually rejecting the association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the cause of his material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is always giving instruction from within and from without. From without He gives instructions as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and from within He tries to convince the living entity that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real happiness. \u201cJust give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be happy,\u201d He says. Thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the Param\u0101tm\u0101 or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward a blissful eternal life of knowledge."}, {"verse": "TEXT 24", "devanagari": "\u092f \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u0935\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0902 \u091a \u0917\u0941\u0923\u0948: \u0938\u0939 \u0964\n\u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0925\u093e \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094b\u093d\u092a\u093f \u0928 \u0938 \u092d\u0942\u092f\u094b\u093d\u092d\u093f\u091c\u093e\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0965 \u0968\u096a \u0965", "verse-text": "ya eva\u1e41 vetti puru\u1e63a\u1e41\nprak\u1e5bti\u1e41 ca gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 saha\nsarvath\u0101 vartam\u0101no \u2019pi\nna sa bh\u016byo \u2019bhij\u0101yate", "synonyms": "ya\u1e25 \u2014 anyone who; evam \u2014 thus; vetti \u2014 understands; puru\u1e63am \u2014 the living entity; prak\u1e5btim \u2014 material nature; ca \u2014 and; gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 \u2014 the modes of material nature; saha \u2014 with; sarvath\u0101 \u2014 in all ways; vartam\u0101na\u1e25 \u2014 being situated; api \u2014 in spite of; na \u2014 never; sa\u1e25 \u2014 he; bh\u016bya\u1e25 \u2014 again; abhij\u0101yate \u2014 takes his birth.", "translation": "One who understands this philosophy concerning material nature, the living entity and the interaction of the modes of nature is sure to attain liberation.

Those who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted among the atheists and agnostics.

Some of the people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually there is no knowledge of philosophy.

Lord Caitanya, who preached K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the modern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from authoritative sources he can progress, especially, according to Lord Caitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. It is stated, therefore, that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually become able to understand everything. The worship of the Supreme Lord will then undoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to change his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become the servant of those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow in his footsteps, one will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee. In this verse particularly, the process of hearing is strongly recommended, and this is very appropriate.

A spiritual master, by various instructions, teaches his students to get free from the material concept of life. For instance, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we find K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructing Arjuna to free him from materialistic considerations.\n\nOne can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its twenty-four elements. The body is the gross manifestation. And the subtle manifestation is the mind and psychological effects. And the symptoms of life are the interaction of these features. But over and above this, there is the soul, and there is also the Supersoul. The soul and the Supersoul are two. This material world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twenty-four material elements. One who can see the constitution of the whole material manifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and can also see the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes eligible for transfer to the spiritual world. These things are meant for contemplation and for realization, and one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of the spiritual master."}], "desc": ""}, {"name": "Chapter Fourteen: The Three Modes of Material Nature", "link": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/14/advanced-view", "verses": [{"verse": "TEXT 1", "devanagari": "\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0935\u093e\u091a\n\u092a\u0930\u0902 \u092d\u0942\u092f: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u093f \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u092e\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e\u092e\u094d \u0964 \u200d\u200d \u0965\n\u092f\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e \u092e\u0941\u0928\u092f: \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u092a\u0930\u093e\u0902 \u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u092e\u093f\u0924\u094b \u0917\u0924\u093e: \u0965 \u0967 \u0965", "verse-text": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\npara\u1e41 bh\u016bya\u1e25 pravak\u1e63y\u0101mi\nj\u00f1\u0101n\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101nam uttamam\nyaj j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 munaya\u1e25 sarve\npar\u0101\u1e41 siddhim ito gat\u0101\u1e25", "synonyms": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca \u2014 the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; param \u2014 transcendental; bh\u016bya\u1e25 \u2014 again; pravak\u1e63y\u0101mi \u2014 I shall speak; j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101n\u0101m \u2014 of all knowledge; j\u00f1\u0101nam \u2014 knowledge; uttamam \u2014 the supreme; yat \u2014 which; j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 \u2014 knowing; munaya\u1e25 \u2014 the sages; sarve \u2014 all; par\u0101m \u2014 transcendental; siddhim \u2014 perfection; ita\u1e25 \u2014 from this world; gat\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 attained.", "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Again I shall declare to you this supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained the supreme perfection.", "purport": "From the Seventh Chapter to the end of the Twelfth Chapter, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in detail reveals the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The mahat-tattva is the total cause of the total cosmic manifestation; and that total substance of the material cause, in which there are three modes of nature, is sometimes called Brahman. The Supreme Personality impregnates that total substance, and thus innumerable universes become possible.

But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion. Actually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material nature is not the cause of the birth of the living entities. The seed is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products of material nature. Thus every living entity, according to his past activities, has a different body, created by this material nature, so that the entity can enjoy or suffer according to his past deeds.

One is happy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities\u2019 conditioned status in nature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge. The representative type is the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to understanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from sinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness.\n\nThe difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples are the scientist and the philosopher. Each is very proud of his knowledge, and because they generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of material happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature. As such, they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they have an attraction for working in that way, they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature.

This means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the embodied soul. The mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, one can understand what is what, but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite. Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a madman cannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement, one becomes degraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in the Vedic literature.

For example, everyone can see that his grandfather has died and therefore he will also die; man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die. So death is sure. Still, people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and night, not caring for the eternal spirit. This is madness. In their madness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding. Such people are very lazy. When they are invited to associate for spiritual understanding, they are not much interested. They are not even active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another symptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required. Six hours of sleep is sufficient, but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day. Such a man appears to be always dejected and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping.

Therefore the sages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness. But activities in the mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity for material happiness is bound to be defeated. If, for example, one wants to have a skyscraper, so much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built. The financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass of wealth, and those who are slaving to construct the building have to render physical toil. The miseries are there. Thus Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 says that in any activity performed under the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely great misery. There may be a little so-called mental happiness \u2013 \u201cI have this house or this money\u201d \u2013 but this is not actual happiness.\n\nAs far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the performer is without knowledge, and therefore all his activities result in present misery, and afterwards he will go on toward animal life. Animal life is always miserable, although, under the spell of the illusory energy, m\u0101y\u0101, the animals do not understand this. Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of ignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will have a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In human society, if one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state. Because of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by the Supreme Lord. Every living creature is a son of the Supreme Lord, and He does not tolerate even an ant\u2019s being killed. One has to pay for it. So indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest kind of ignorance. A human being has no need to kill animals, because God has supplied so many nice things. If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be understood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark. Of all kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance. In the Vedic literature (\u1e5ag Veda 9.46.4) the words gobhi\u1e25 pr\u012b\u1e47ita-matsaram indicate that one who, being fully satisfied by milk, is desirous of killing the cow is in the grossest ignorance. There is also a prayer in the Vedic literature that states:\n\n\u201cMy Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and You are the well-wisher of the entire human society and world.\u201d (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a 1.19.65) The purport is that special mention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as are the symbol of spiritual education, and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food; these two living creatures, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the cows, must be given all protection \u2013 that is real advancement of civilization. In modern human society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged. It is to be understood, then, that human society is advancing in the wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation. A civilization which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization. The present human civilization is, of course, grossly misled by the modes of passion and ignorance.

In these verses, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first indicates that a person transcendentally situated has no envy and does not hanker for anything. When a living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body, it is to be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of material nature. When he is actually out of the body, then he is out of the clutches of the material modes of nature. But as long as he is not out of the material body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will automatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of the material body, he acts only for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, sense gratification automatically stops. One does not need this material body, and he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body. The qualities of the material modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is aloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire to enjoy the body, nor does he desire to get out of it. Thus transcendentally situated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become free from the influence of the modes of material nature.\n\nThe next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated person. The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and dishonor offered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is not affected by such false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him. He accepts things that are favorable for his duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, otherwise he has no necessity of anything material, either a stone or gold. He takes everyone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy. He is equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he has nothing to do with material existence. Social and political issues do not affect him, because he knows the situation of temporary upheavals and disturbances. He does not attempt anything for his own sake. He can attempt anything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but for his personal self he does not attempt anything. By such behavior one becomes actually transcendentally situated."}, {"verse": "TEXT 26", "devanagari": "\u092e\u093e\u0902 \u091a \u092f\u094b\u093d\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092d\u093f\u091a\u093e\u0930\u0947\u0923 \u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0917\u0947\u0928 \u0938\u0947\u0935\u0924\u0947 \u0964\n\u0938 \u0917\u0941\u0923\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0938\u092e\u0924\u0940\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0948\u0924\u093e\u0928\u094d\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u092d\u0942\u092f\u093e\u092f \u0915\u0932\u094d\u092a\u0924\u0947 \u0965 \u0968\u096c \u0965", "verse-text": "m\u0101\u1e41 ca yo \u2019vyabhic\u0101re\u1e47a\nbhakti-yogena sevate\nsa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101n\nbrahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate", "synonyms": "m\u0101m \u2014 unto Me; ca \u2014 also; ya\u1e25 \u2014 a person who; avyabhic\u0101re\u1e47a \u2014 without fail; bhakti-yogena \u2014 by devotional service; sevate \u2014 renders service; sa\u1e25 \u2014 he; gu\u1e47\u0101n \u2014 the modes of material nature; samat\u012btya \u2014 transcending; et\u0101n \u2014 all these; brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya \u2014 elevated to the Brahman platform; kalpate \u2014 becomes.", "translation": "One who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.", "purport": "This verse is a reply to Arjuna\u2019s third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a activities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a activities are known as bhakti-yoga \u2013 always acting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This includes not only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but His different plenary expansions such as R\u0101ma and N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities. So if one engages himself in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, one can overcome them easily. This has already been explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire equality with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity, in his spiritual position, is as good as gold, as good as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there would be no question of bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there, and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there would be no meaning to bhakti-yoga. If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature, brahmaiva san brahm\u0101py eti. One can attain the Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity as an individual soul."}, {"verse": "TEXT 27", "devanagari": "\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0923\u094b \u0939\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u0939\u092e\u092e\u0943\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f \u091a \u0964\n\u0936\u093e\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092f \u091a \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0938\u0941\u0916\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0948\u0915\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u0938\u094d\u092f \u091a \u0965 \u0968\u096d \u0965", "verse-text": "brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham\nam\u1e5btasy\u0101vyayasya ca\n\u015b\u0101\u015bvatasya ca dharmasya\nsukhasyaik\u0101ntikasya ca", "synonyms": "brahma\u1e47a\u1e25 \u2014 of the impersonal brahma-jyotir; hi \u2014 certainly; prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 \u2014 the rest; aham \u2014 I am; am\u1e5btasya \u2014 of the immortal; avyayasya \u2014 of the imperishable; ca \u2014 also; \u015b\u0101\u015bvatasya \u2014 of the eternal; ca \u2014 and; dharmasya \u2014 of the constitutional position; sukhasya \u2014 of happiness; aik\u0101ntikasya \u2014 ultimate; ca \u2014 also.", "translation": "And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is immortal, imperishable and eternal and is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness.", "purport": "The constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity and happiness. Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization. Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the impersonal Brahman are within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior, material nature with fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature. When a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates himself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the Supreme. This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage in self-realization. At this stage the Brahman-realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. If he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic literature. The four Kum\u0101ras were situated first in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional service. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of falling down. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going further, with no information of the Supreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Vedic language it is also said, raso vai sa\u1e25, rasa\u1e41 hy ev\u0101ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101nand\u012b bhavati: \u201cWhen one understands the Personality of Godhead, the reservoir of pleasure, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he actually becomes transcendentally blissful.\u201d (Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad 2.7.1) The Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him there is an exchange of these six opulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king. And so eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, and eternal life accompany devotional service. Therefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, or imperishability, is included in devotional service. This is already possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service.\n\nThe living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over the material world, and due to this he falls down. In his constitutional position, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but association with material nature entangles him in the different modes of material nature \u2013 goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of these three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By engagement in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is immediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional service, beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering \u2013 the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service \u2013 should be practiced in the association of devotees. Gradually, by such association, by the influence of the spiritual master, one\u2019s material desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the Lord\u2019s transcendental loving service. This method is prescribed from the twenty-second to the last verse of this chapter. Devotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental pastimes, read of the different activities of the Lord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His devotees. By following such a process one becomes completely detached from all material activities. One who can thus situate himself in the brahma-jyotir or the different varieties of the Brahman conception is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality."}], "desc": ""}, {"name": "Chapter Fifteen: The Yoga of the Supreme Person", "link": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/15/advanced-view", "verses": [{"verse": "TEXT 1", "devanagari": "\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0935\u093e\u091a\n\u090a\u0930\u094d\u0927\u094d\u0935\u092e\u0942\u0932\u092e\u0927:\u0936\u093e\u0916\u092e\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0924\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0930\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092f\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u091b\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093e\u0902\u0938\u093f \u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092a\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093e\u0928\u093f \u092f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u0935\u0947\u0926 \u0938 \u0935\u0947\u0926\u0935\u093f\u0924\u094d \u0965 \u0967 \u0965", "verse-text": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\n\u016brdhva-m\u016blam adha\u1e25-\u015b\u0101kham\na\u015bvattha\u1e41 pr\u0101hur avyayam\nchand\u0101\u1e41si yasya par\u1e47\u0101ni\nyas ta\u1e41 veda sa veda-vit", "synonyms": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca \u2014 the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; \u016brdhva-m\u016blam \u2014 with roots above; adha\u1e25 \u2014 downwards; \u015b\u0101kham \u2014 branches; a\u015bvattham \u2014 a banyan tree; pr\u0101hu\u1e25 \u2014 is said; avyayam \u2014 eternal; chand\u0101\u1e41si \u2014 the Vedic hymns; yasya \u2014 of which; par\u1e47\u0101ni \u2014 the leaves; ya\u1e25 \u2014 anyone who; tam \u2014 that; veda \u2014 knows; sa\u1e25 \u2014 he; veda-vit \u2014 the knower of the Vedas.", "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: It is said that there is an imperishable banyan tree that has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.", "purport": "After the discussion of the importance of bhakti-yoga, one may question, \u201cWhat about the Vedas?\u201d It is explained in this chapter that the purpose of Vedic study is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore one who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, who is engaged in devotional service, already knows the Vedas.\n\nThe entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree. For one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyan tree. He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another. The tree of this material world has no end, and for one who is attached to this tree, there is no possibility of liberation. The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating oneself, are called the leaves of this tree. This tree\u2019s roots grow upward because they begin from where Brahm\u0101 is located, the topmost planet of this universe. If one can understand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out of it.\n\nThis process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it has been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the material entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. Now, the basic principle of devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to the transcendental service of the Lord. The process of breaking attachment to the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter. The root of this material existence grows upward. This means that it begins from the total material substance, from the topmost planet of the universe. From there, the whole universe is expanded, with so many branches, representing the various planetary systems. The fruits represent the results of the living entities\u2019 activities, namely, religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation.\n\nNow, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its branches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can be found beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank reflect upon the water with their branches down and roots up. In other words, the tree of this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual world. This reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as a tree\u2019s reflection is situated on water. Desire is the cause of things\u2019 being situated in this reflected material light. One who wants to get out of this material existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study. Then he can cut off his relationship with it.\n\nThis tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica. Everything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahman to be the root of this material tree, and from the root, according to S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, come prak\u1e5bti, puru\u1e63a, then the three gu\u1e47as, then the five gross elements (pa\u00f1ca-mah\u0101-bh\u016bta), then the ten senses (da\u015bendriya), mind, etc. In this way they divide up the whole material world into twenty-four elements. If Brahman is the center of all manifestations, then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180 degrees, and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world. The material world is the perverted reflection, so the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness, but in reality. The prak\u1e5bti is the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and the puru\u1e63a is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Since this manifestation is material, it is temporary. A reflection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen. But the origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal. The material reflection of the real tree has to be cut off. When it is said that a person knows the Vedas, it is assumed that he knows how to cut off attachment to this material world. If one knows that process, he actually knows the Vedas. One who is attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the Vedas is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree. He does not exactly know the purpose of the Vedas. The purpose of the Vedas, as disclosed by the Personality of Godhead Himself, is to cut down this reflected tree and attain the real tree of the spiritual world."}, {"verse": "TEXT 2", "devanagari": "\u0905\u0927\u0936\u094d\u091a\u094b\u0930\u094d\u0927\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u0943\u0924\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0936\u093e\u0916\u093e\n\u0917\u0941\u0923\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0943\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0937\u092f\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0932\u093e: \u0964\n\u0905\u0927\u0936\u094d\u091a \u092e\u0942\u0932\u093e\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0928\u0941\u0938\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093f\n\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0941\u092c\u0928\u094d\u0927\u0940\u0928\u093f \u092e\u0928\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0932\u094b\u0915\u0947 \u0965 \u0968 \u0965", "verse-text": "adha\u015b cordhva\u1e41 pras\u1e5bt\u0101s tasya \u015b\u0101kh\u0101\ngu\u1e47a-prav\u1e5bddh\u0101 vi\u1e63aya-prav\u0101l\u0101\u1e25\nadha\u015b ca m\u016bl\u0101ny anusantat\u0101ni\nkarm\u0101nubandh\u012bni manu\u1e63ya-loke", "synonyms": "adha\u1e25 \u2014 downward; ca \u2014 and; \u016brdhvam \u2014 upward; pras\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 extended; tasya \u2014 its; \u015b\u0101kh\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 branches; gu\u1e47a \u2014 by the modes of material nature; prav\u1e5bddh\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 developed; vi\u1e63aya \u2014 sense objects; prav\u0101l\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 twigs; adha\u1e25 \u2014 downward; ca \u2014 and; m\u016bl\u0101ni \u2014 roots; anusantat\u0101ni \u2014 extended; karma \u2014 to work; anubandh\u012bni \u2014 bound; manu\u1e63ya-loke \u2014 in the world of human society.", "translation": "The branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three modes of material nature.

Its branches spread in all directions. In the lower parts, there are variegated manifestations of living entities \u2013 human beings, animals, horses, cows, dogs, cats, etc. These are situated on the lower parts of the branches, whereas on the upper parts are higher forms of living entities: the demigods, Gandharvas and many other higher species of life. As a tree is nourished by water, so this tree is nourished by the three modes of material nature. Sometimes we find that a tract of land is barren for want of sufficient water, and sometimes a tract is very green; similarly, where particular modes of material nature are proportionately greater in quantity, the different species of life are manifested accordingly.\n\nThe twigs of the tree are considered to be the sense objects. By development of the different modes of nature we develop different senses, and by the senses we enjoy different varieties of sense objects. The tips of the branches are the senses \u2013 the ears, nose, eyes, etc. \u2013 which are attached to the enjoyment of different sense objects. The twigs are sound, form, touch, and so on \u2013 the sense objects. The subsidiary roots are attachments and aversions, which are by-products of different varieties of suffering and sense enjoyment. The tendencies toward piety and impiety are considered to develop from these secondary roots, which spread in all directions.

Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in trouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering the land, this earth, to belong to human society, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial, social and national affections. These faulty associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own. And when one has an understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain. He becomes full in knowledge; then it is possible for him to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."}, {"verse": "TEXT 6", "devanagari": "\u0928 \u0924\u0926\u094d\u092d\u200d\u093e\u0938\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0938\u0942\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b \u0928 \u0936\u0936\u093e\u0919\u094d\u0915\u094b \u0928 \u092a\u093e\u0935\u0915: \u0964\n\u092f\u0926\u094d\u0917\u200d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e \u0928 \u0928\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0924\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u092e \u092a\u0930\u092e\u0902 \u092e\u092e \u0965 \u096c \u0965", "verse-text": "na tad bh\u0101sayate s\u016bryo\nna \u015ba\u015b\u0101\u1e45ko na p\u0101vaka\u1e25\nyad gatv\u0101 na nivartante\ntad dh\u0101ma parama\u1e41 mama", "synonyms": "na \u2014 not; tat \u2014 that; bh\u0101sayate \u2014 illuminates; s\u016brya\u1e25 \u2014 the sun; na \u2014 nor; \u015ba\u015b\u0101\u1e45ka\u1e25 \u2014 the moon; na \u2014 nor; p\u0101vaka\u1e25 \u2014 fire, electricity; yat \u2014 where; gatv\u0101 \u2014 going; na \u2014 never; nivartante \u2014 they come back; tat dh\u0101ma \u2014 that abode; paramam \u2014 supreme; mama \u2014 My.", "translation": "That supreme abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by fire or electricity.

In the spiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity, because all the planets are self-luminous. We have only one planet in this universe, the sun, which is self-luminous, but all the planets in the spiritual sky are self-luminous. The shining effulgence of all those planets (called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas) constitutes the shining sky known as the brahma-jyotir. Actually, the effulgence is emanating from the planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Part of that shining effulgence is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material world. Other than this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets, which are called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas, chief of which is Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\n\nAs long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in conditional life, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky by cutting through the false, perverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then there is no chance of his coming back here. In his conditional life, the living entity considers himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated state he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes an associate of the Supreme Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge.\n\nOne should be captivated by this information. He should desire to transfer himself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection of reality. For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very difficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness there is a chance of gradually becoming detached. One has to associate himself with devotees, those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should search out a society dedicated to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service. In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world. One cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing himself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as described in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false representation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all kinds of processes by material nature is described. Only devotional service is described as purely transcendental.\n\nThe words parama\u1e41 mama are very important here. Actually every nook and corner is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is paramam, full of six opulences. The Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad (2.2.15) also confirms that in the spiritual world there is no need of sunshine, moonshine or stars (na tatra s\u016bryo bh\u0101ti na candra-t\u0101rakam), for the whole spiritual sky is illuminated by the internal potency of the Supreme Lord.

The living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord \u2013 eternally. It is not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated state becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is clearly said, san\u0101tana\u1e25. According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord manifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary expansions are called vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva and the secondary expansions are called the living entities. In other words, the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva is the personal expansion, and the living entities are the separated expansions. By His personal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like Lord R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha-deva, Vi\u1e63\u1e47um\u016brti and all the predominating Deities in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. The separated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always present. Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their identities. As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities also have fragmental portions of His qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity, as an individual soul, has his personal individuality and a minute form of independence. By misuse of that independence one becomes a conditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case, he is qualitatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he is freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material world.\n\nThe living entities, not only human beings and the cats and dogs, but even the greater controllers of the material world \u2013 Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and even Vi\u1e63\u1e47u \u2013 are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not temporary manifestations. The word kar\u1e63ati (\u201cstruggling\u201d or \u201cgrappling hard\u201d) is very significant. The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode of goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that the conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the senses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his spiritual body manifests itself in its individual capacity.

It is stated here that when a living entity gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he revives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to face, and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. From sm\u1e5bti also it is understood, vasanti yatra puru\u1e63\u0101\u1e25 sarve vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-m\u016brtaya\u1e25: in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s. As far as bodily construction is concerned, there is no difference between the part-and-parcel living entities and the expansions of vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti. In other words, at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\nThe words mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25 (\u201cfragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord\u201d) are also very significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some material broken part. We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not materially conceived. It is not like matter, which can be cut into pieces and joined together again. That conception is not applicable here, because the Sanskrit word san\u0101tana (\u201ceternal\u201d) is used. The fragmental portion is eternal. It is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter that in each and every individual body the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present (dehino \u2019smin yath\u0101 dehe). That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one with the Lord, just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold."}, {"verse": "TEXT 8", "devanagari": "\u0936\u0930\u0940\u0930\u0902 \u092f\u0926\u0935\u093e\u092a\u094d\u200d\u0928\u094b\u0924\u093f \u092f\u091a\u094d\u091a\u200d\u093e\u092a\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0924\u0940\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930: \u0964\n\u0917\u0943\u0939\u0940\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0948\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093f \u0938\u0902\u092f\u093e\u0924\u093f \u0935\u093e\u092f\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0928\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0936\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d \u0965 \u096e \u0965", "verse-text": "\u015bar\u012bra\u1e41 yad av\u0101pnoti\nyac c\u0101py utkr\u0101mat\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25\ng\u1e5bh\u012btvait\u0101ni sa\u1e41y\u0101ti\nv\u0101yur gandh\u0101n iv\u0101\u015bay\u0101t", "synonyms": "\u015bar\u012bram \u2014 the body; yat \u2014 as; av\u0101pnoti \u2014 gets; yat \u2014 as; ca api \u2014 also; utkr\u0101mati \u2014 gives up; \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 \u2014 the lord of the body; g\u1e5bh\u012btv\u0101 \u2014 taking; et\u0101ni \u2014 all these; sa\u1e41y\u0101ti \u2014 goes away; v\u0101yu\u1e25 \u2014 the air; gandh\u0101n \u2014 smells; iva \u2014 like; \u0101\u015bay\u0101t \u2014 from their source.", "translation": "The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life from one body to another, as the air carries aromas.

There are different universes and solar systems, and there are different suns, moons and planets also, but in each universe there is only one sun. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.21), the moon is one of the stars (nak\u1e63atr\u0101\u1e47\u0101m aha\u1e41 \u015ba\u015b\u012b). Sunlight is due to the spiritual effulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun, the activities of human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare their foodstuff, they set fire to start the factories, etc. So many things are done with the help of fire. Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight are so pleasing to the living entities. Without their help no living entity can live. So if one can understand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then one\u2019s K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will begin. By the moonshine, all the vegetables are nourished. The moonshine is so pleasing that people can easily understand that they are living by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without His mercy there cannot be sun, without His mercy there cannot be moon, and without His mercy there cannot be fire, and without the help of sun, moon and fire, no one can live.

The Lord enters into every atom, every planet and every living being. That is discussed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. It is said there that one plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Param\u0101tm\u0101, enters into the planets, the universe, the living entity, and even into the atom. So due to His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit soul is there, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is out of the body and the body is dead, the body sinks. Of course when it is decomposed it floats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is dead, he at once sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust. If someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust\u2019s falling, but if one throws it in the air it will fall down. Similarly, these planets, which are floating in the air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form of the Supreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving and nonmoving things stay in their place. It is said in the Vedic hymns that because of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving. Were it not for Him, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it is due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all vegetables. Due to the moon\u2019s influence, the vegetables become delicious. Without the moonshine, the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent. Human society is working, living comfortably and enjoying food due to the supply from the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, mankind could not survive. The word ras\u0101tmaka\u1e25 is very significant.

The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his present body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord. Although he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where he ended his last life. So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand the Vedas from Him. If one is serious about understanding the Vedic knowledge, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives the required intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vedic literature confirms this: yo \u2019sau sarvair vedair g\u012byate. In all Vedic literature, beginning from the four Vedas, Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra and the Upani\u1e63ads and Pur\u0101\u1e47as, the glories of the Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performance of Vedic rituals, discussion of the Vedic philosophy and worship of the Lord in devotional service, He is attained. Therefore the purpose of the Vedas is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Vedas give us direction by which to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the process of realizing Him. The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (1.1.4) confirms this in the following words: tat tu samanvay\u0101t. One can attain perfection in three stages. By understanding Vedic literature one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by performing the different processes one can approach Him, and at the end one can attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

But in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore there is no change. In the material world the living entity undergoes six changes \u2013 birth, growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and vanishing. These are the changes of the material body.

The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, this fact is being stressed at every step.

One should actually receive the Vedic message from authorities like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His representatives. Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this source.

In other words, by understanding this philosophy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental service, everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material nature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding. Wherever devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot coexist. Devotional service to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the same because they are spiritual; devotional service takes place within the internal energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is said to be the sun, and ignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no question of darkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under the proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of ignorance.\n\nEveryone must take to this consciousness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engage in devotional service to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to this position of understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he may be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent.\n\nThe word anagha, by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant. Anagha, \u201cO sinless one,\u201d means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions it is very difficult to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One has to become free from all contamination, all sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes to the stage of sinlessness.\n\nWhile one is performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there are certain things which require to be vanquished altogether. The most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the heart. The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material nature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord. The second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity to lord it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and the possession of matter. The problems of material existence are due to these weaknesses of the heart. In this chapter the first five verses describe the process of freeing oneself from these weaknesses of heart, and the rest of the chapter, from the sixth verse through the end, discusses puru\u1e63ottama-yoga.\n\n"}], "desc": ""}, {"name": "Chapter Sixteen: The Divine and Demoniac Natures", "link": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/16/advanced-view", "verses": [{"verse": "TEXTS 1-3", "devanagari": "\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0935\u093e\u091a\n\u0905\u092d\u092f\u0902 \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0938\u0902\u0936\u200d\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0930\u094d\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u092f\u094b\u0917\u0935\u094d\u092f\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u093f: \u0964\n\u0926\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u0926\u092e\u0936\u094d\u091a \u092f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0936\u094d\u091a \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u092a \u0906\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0935\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0967 \u0965\n\u0905\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0938\u093e \u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f\u092e\u0915\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0927\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0917: \u0936\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0930\u092a\u0948\u0936\u200d\u0941\u0928\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u0926\u092f\u093e \u092d\u0942\u0924\u0947\u0937\u094d\u0935\u0932\u094b\u0932\u0941\u092a\u094d\u200d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0935\u0902 \u0939\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0930\u091a\u093e\u092a\u0932\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0968 \u0965\n\u0924\u0947\u091c: \u0915\u094d\u0937\u092e\u093e \u0927\u0943\u0924\u093f: \u0936\u094c\u091a\u092e\u0926\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0939\u094b \u0928\u093e\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0924\u093e \u0964\n\u092d\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0926\u0902 \u0926\u0948\u0935\u0940\u092e\u092d\u093f\u091c\u093e\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0965 \u0969 \u0965", "verse-text": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\nabhaya\u1e41 sattva-sa\u1e41\u015buddhir\nj\u00f1\u0101na-yoga-vyavasthiti\u1e25\nd\u0101na\u1e41 dama\u015b ca yaj\u00f1a\u015b ca\nsv\u0101dhy\u0101yas tapa \u0101rjavam\n\nahi\u1e41s\u0101 satyam akrodhas\nty\u0101ga\u1e25 \u015b\u0101ntir apai\u015bunam\nday\u0101 bh\u016bte\u1e63v aloluptva\u1e41\nm\u0101rdava\u1e41 hr\u012br ac\u0101palam\n\nteja\u1e25 k\u1e63am\u0101 dh\u1e5bti\u1e25 \u015baucam\nadroho n\u0101ti-m\u0101nit\u0101\nbhavanti sampada\u1e41 daiv\u012bm\nabhij\u0101tasya bh\u0101rata", "synonyms": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca \u2014 the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; abhayam \u2014 fearlessness; sattva-sa\u1e41\u015buddhi\u1e25 \u2014 purification of one\u2019s existence; j\u00f1\u0101na \u2014 in knowledge; yoga \u2014 of linking up; vyavasthiti\u1e25 \u2014 the situation; d\u0101nam \u2014 charity; dama\u1e25 \u2014 controlling the mind; ca \u2014 and; yaj\u00f1a\u1e25 \u2014 performance of sacrifice; ca \u2014 and; sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya\u1e25 \u2014 study of Vedic literature; tapa\u1e25 \u2014 austerity; \u0101rjavam \u2014 simplicity; ahi\u1e41s\u0101 \u2014 nonviolence; satyam \u2014 truthfulness; akrodha\u1e25 \u2014 freedom from anger; ty\u0101ga\u1e25 \u2014 renunciation; \u015b\u0101nti\u1e25 \u2014 tranquillity; apai\u015bunam \u2014 aversion to fault-finding; day\u0101 \u2014 mercy; bh\u016bte\u1e63u \u2014 towards all living entities; aloluptvam \u2014 freedom from greed; m\u0101rdavam \u2014 gentleness; hr\u012b\u1e25 \u2014 modesty; ac\u0101palam \u2014 determination; teja\u1e25 \u2014 vigor; k\u1e63am\u0101 \u2014 forgiveness; dh\u1e5bti\u1e25 \u2014 fortitude; \u015baucam \u2014 cleanliness; adroha\u1e25 \u2014 freedom from envy; na \u2014 not; ati-m\u0101nit\u0101 \u2014 expectation of honor; bhavanti \u2014 are; sampadam \u2014 the qualities; daiv\u012bm \u2014 the transcendental nature; abhij\u0101tasya \u2014 of one who is born of; bh\u0101rata \u2014 O son of Bharata.", "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Fearlessness; purification of one\u2019s existence; cultivation of spiritual knowledge; charity; self-control; performance of sacrifice; study of the Vedas; austerity; simplicity; nonviolence; truthfulness; freedom from anger; renunciation; tranquillity; aversion to faultfinding; compassion for all living entities; freedom from covetousness; gentleness; modesty; steady determination; vigor; forgiveness; fortitude; cleanliness; and freedom from envy and from the passion for honor \u2013 these transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata, belong to godly men endowed with divine nature.", "purport": "In the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material world was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the Ninth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or demons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and such activities are known as daiv\u012b prak\u1e5bti, transcendental by nature. Those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities and the demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities.\n\nThe word abhij\u0101tasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra. If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles recommended for the social life of the human being. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Sex life is not condemned, provided the process is used in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so that they may become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children born of a father and mother absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nThe social institution known as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma \u2013 the institution dividing society into four divisions of social life and four occupational divisions or castes \u2013 is not meant to divide human society according to birth. Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications. They are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so that he can get liberated from the material world.\n\nIn the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution the sanny\u0101s\u012b, or the person in the renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the k\u1e63atriyas, the vai\u015byas and the \u015b\u016bdras, but a sanny\u0101s\u012b, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be the spiritual master of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as also. For a sanny\u0101s\u012b, the first qualification should be fearlessness. Because a sanny\u0101s\u012b has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one thinks, \u201cAfter I leave my connections, who will protect me?\u201d he should not accept the renounced order of life. One must be fully convinced that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is always within, that He is seeing everything, and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus have firm conviction that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Param\u0101tm\u0101 will take care of a soul surrendered to Him. \u201cI shall never be alone,\u201d one should think. \u201cEven if I live in the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He will give me all protection.\u201d That conviction is called abhayam, fearlessness. This state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life.\n\nThen he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all, a sanny\u0101s\u012b is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal sanny\u0101s\u012b, and when He was at Pur\u012b His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sanny\u0101s\u012b not to have close connections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sanny\u0101s\u012b, intimate relations with women and possession of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden. The ideal sanny\u0101s\u012b was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the sanny\u0101sa order of life in connection with association with women. One of His personal associates, namely Cho\u1e6da Harid\u0101sa, was associated with Lord Caitanya along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow or other this Cho\u1e6da Harid\u0101sa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, \u201cFor a sanny\u0101s\u012b or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back home, back to Godhead, for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification \u2013 not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity \u2013 is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires.\u201d So these are the processes for purification.\n\nThe next item is j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga-vyavasthiti: being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. Sanny\u0101s\u012b life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A sanny\u0101s\u012b is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sanny\u0101s\u012b goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is the duty of a sanny\u0101s\u012b. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with logic and understanding, and if one is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if one has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A sanny\u0101s\u012b, or one in the renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-sa\u1e41\u015buddhi (purity) and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga (knowledge).\n\nThe next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all over the world. Thus a householder should give in charity to institutional societies that are engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are different kinds of charity, as will be explained later on \u2013 charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended, because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be given only to propagate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all over the world. That is charity in the mode of goodness.\n\nThen as far as dama (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other orders of religious society, but is especially meant for the householder. Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life, which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality, but is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If he is able to beget children who will be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.\n\nSacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders, because sacrifices require a large amount of money. Those in other orders of life, namely brahmacarya, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa, have no money; they live by begging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householders. They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice recommended in this age is called sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. This sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the householder.\n\nThen sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya, Vedic study, is meant for brahmacarya, or student life. Brahmac\u0101r\u012bs should have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge. This is called sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya.\n\nTapas, or austerity, is especially meant for the retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four divisions of life \u2013 brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. So after g\u1e5bhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasya. The entire var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma society is meant for tapasya. Without tapasya, or austerity, no human being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is recommended neither in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Such theories are manufactured by show-bottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don\u2019t restrict the lives of their students, nor their own lives. But that method is not approved by the Vedas.\n\nAs far as the brahminical quality of simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the brahmac\u0101r\u012b \u0101\u015brama, g\u1e5bhastha \u0101\u015brama, v\u0101naprastha \u0101\u015brama or sanny\u0101sa \u0101\u015brama. One should be very simple and straightforward.\n\nAhi\u1e41s\u0101 means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is for everyone. When there is no alternative, one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an ample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals. Real ahi\u1e41s\u0101 means not checking anyone\u2019s progressive life. The animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one\u2019s palate. This is called ahi\u1e41s\u0101.\n\nSatyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. That is the process for understanding the Vedas. \u015aruti means that one should hear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that misinterpret the original text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\n\nAkrodha means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is a product of the mode of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger. Apai\u015bunam means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hr\u012b means that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable. Ac\u0101palam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and determination.\n\nThe word tejas used here is meant for the k\u1e63atriyas. The k\u1e63atriyas should always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should not pose themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it. But a person who is able to curb down his enemy may under certain conditions show forgiveness. He may excuse minor offenses.\n\n\u015aaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one\u2019s dealings also. It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the black market. N\u0101ti-m\u0101nit\u0101, not expecting honor, applies to the \u015b\u016bdras, the worker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of the four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the \u015b\u016bdras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.\n\nAll these twenty-six qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities. They should be cultivated according to the different statuses of social and occupational order. The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization."}, {"verse": "TEXT 4", "devanagari": "\u0926\u092e\u094d\u092d\u094b \u0926\u0930\u094d\u092a\u094b\u093d\u092d\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0936\u094d\u091a \u0915\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0927: \u092a\u093e\u0930\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092f\u092e\u0947\u0935 \u091a \u0964\n\u0905\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u091a\u093e\u092d\u093f\u091c\u093e\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0926\u092e\u093e\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0940\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u096a \u0965", "verse-text": "dambho darpo \u2019bhim\u0101na\u015b ca\nkrodha\u1e25 p\u0101ru\u1e63yam eva ca\naj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 c\u0101bhij\u0101tasya\np\u0101rtha sampadam \u0101sur\u012bm", "synonyms": "dambha\u1e25 \u2014 pride; darpa\u1e25 \u2014 arrogance; abhim\u0101na\u1e25 \u2014 conceit; ca \u2014 and; krodha\u1e25 \u2014 anger; p\u0101ru\u1e63yam \u2014 harshness; eva \u2014 certainly; ca \u2014 and; aj\u00f1\u0101nam \u2014 ignorance; ca \u2014 and; abhij\u0101tasya \u2014 of one who is born of; p\u0101rtha \u2014 O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101; sampadam \u2014 the qualities; \u0101sur\u012bm \u2014 of the demoniac nature.", "translation": "Pride, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness and ignorance \u2013 these qualities belong to those of demoniac nature, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101.", "purport": "In this verse, the royal road to hell is described.

Especially among the \u0100ryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced civilized peoples, those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are supposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them. Most of them do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency to follow them. They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions. The demons are not clean, either externally or internally. One should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth, shaving, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. The demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness.\n\nAs for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior, such as the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, which is the law of the human race. Even up to today, those who are Hindu follow the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Laws of inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are not given freedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as much freedom as men. However, this has not improved the social condition of the world. Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age. This is proper social behavior according to the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. But modern education has artificially devised a puffed-up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society. The social condition of women is thus not very good now, although those who are married are in a better condition than those who are proclaiming their so-called freedom. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable."}, {"verse": "TEXT 8", "devanagari": "\u0905\u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f\u092e\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0902 \u0924\u0947 \u091c\u0917\u0926\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0930\u0928\u0940\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u092e\u094d \u0964\n\u0905\u092a\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0930\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0942\u0924\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u092e\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0924\u094d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0939\u0948\u0924\u0941\u0915\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u096e \u0965", "verse-text": "asatyam aprati\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e41 te\njagad \u0101hur an\u012b\u015bvaram\naparaspara-sambh\u016bta\u1e41\nkim anyat k\u0101ma-haitukam", "synonyms": "asatyam \u2014 unreal; aprati\u1e63\u1e6dham \u2014 without foundation; te \u2014 they; jagat \u2014 the cosmic manifestation; \u0101hu\u1e25 \u2014 say; an\u012b\u015bvaram \u2014 with no controller; aparaspara \u2014 without cause; sambh\u016btam \u2014 arisen; kim anyat \u2014 there is no other cause; k\u0101ma-haitukam \u2014 it is due to lust only.", "translation": "They say that this world is unreal, with no foundation, no God in control.

They have their own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that there is no reason to believe that there is a God behind it. For them there is no difference between spirit and matter, and they do not accept the Supreme Spirit. Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of ignorance. According to them, everything is void, and whatever manifestation exists is due to our ignorance in perception. They take it for granted that all manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance, just as in a dream we may create so many things which actually have no existence. Then when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the demons say that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying this dream. And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their dreamland. They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul. For them it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and there is no question of the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, the whole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic manifestation. Therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation, and there is no other cause.

That is unlimited. He thinks only of how much assessment he has just now and schemes to engage that stock of wealth further and further. For that reason, he does not hesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the black market for illegal gratification. He is enamored by the possessions he has already, such as land, family, house and bank balance, and he is always planning to improve them. He believes in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he is gaining is due to his past good deeds. He is given an opportunity to accumulate such things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in the strength of his personal work, not in the law of karma. According to the law of karma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The demoniac think that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of one\u2019s personal ability. They do not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of people, beauty and education. Anyone who comes into competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy. There are many demoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes more and more deep \u2013 between persons, then between families, then between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there is constant strife, war and enmity all over the world.\n\nEach demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others. Generally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a demoniac preacher tells his followers: \u201cWhy are you seeking God elsewhere? You are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don\u2019t believe in God. Throw away God. God is dead.\u201d These are the demoniac\u2019s preachings.\n\nAlthough the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or even more so, he thinks that no one is richer than he and that no one is more influential than he. As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is concerned, he does not believe in performing yaj\u00f1as, or sacrifices. Demons think that they will manufacture their own process of yaj\u00f1a and prepare some machine by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best example of such a demoniac man was R\u0101va\u1e47a. He offered a program to the people by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without performing sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the Vedas. Similarly, in the present age such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems by mechanical arrangements. These are examples of bewilderment. The result is that, without their knowledge, they are gliding toward hell. Here the Sanskrit word moha-j\u0101la is very significant.

If one understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and becomes situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, engaging himself in devotional service, he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge offered by the Vedic literature. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu made this process very easy: He asked people simply to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Deity. One who is directly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as having studied all Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of course, for the ordinary persons who are not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of the Vedas. One should act accordingly, without argument. That is called following the principles of \u015b\u0101stra, or scripture. \u015a\u0101stra is without the four principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned. These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the \u015b\u0101stra \u2013 being above these defects \u2013 are accepted without alteration by all great saints, \u0101c\u0101ryas and great souls.\n\nIn India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, lead their lives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without following the principles of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage. One who actually, therefore, understands the purport of the \u015b\u0101stras is considered fortunate.\n\nIn human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest offense of human life. Therefore, m\u0101y\u0101, the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They disobey the instructions of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are some of the defects of human society which lead to the demoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then one\u2019s life becomes successful."}], "desc": ""}, {"name": "Chapter Seventeen: The Divisions of Faith", "link": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/17/advanced-view", "verses": [{"verse": "TEXT 1", "devanagari": "\u0905\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0941\u0928 \u0909\u0935\u093e\u091a\n\u092f\u0947 \u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f\u092e\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0938\u0943\u091c\u094d\u092f \u092f\u091c\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0926\u094d\u0927\u092f\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e: \u0964\n\u0924\u0947\u0937\u093e\u0902 \u0928\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e \u0924\u0941 \u0915\u093e \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923 \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092e\u093e\u0939\u094b \u0930\u091c\u0938\u094d\u0924\u092e: \u0965 \u0967 \u0965", "verse-text": "arjuna uv\u0101ca\nye \u015b\u0101stra-vidhim uts\u1e5bjya\nyajante \u015braddhay\u0101nvit\u0101\u1e25\nte\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 tu k\u0101 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\nsattvam \u0101ho rajas tama\u1e25", "synonyms": "arjuna\u1e25 uv\u0101ca \u2014 Arjuna said; ye \u2014 those who; \u015b\u0101stra-vidhim \u2014 the regulations of scripture; uts\u1e5bjya \u2014 giving up; yajante \u2014 worship; \u015braddhay\u0101 \u2014 full faith; anvit\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 possessed of; te\u1e63\u0101m \u2014 of them; ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 \u2014 the faith; tu \u2014 but; k\u0101 \u2014 what; k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; sattvam \u2014 in goodness; \u0101ho \u2014 or else; raja\u1e25 \u2014 in passion; tama\u1e25 \u2014 in ignorance.", "translation": "Arjuna inquired: O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, what is the situation of those who do not follow the principles of scripture but worship according to their own imagination?

But his faith is considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has acquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with certain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, is originally a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life, he generates his own position by association with the different varieties of material nature. The resultant artificial faith and existence are only material. Although one may be conducted by some impression, or some conception of life, originally he is nirgu\u1e47a, or transcendental. Therefore one has to become cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired, in order to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the only path back without fear: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one does not take to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature.\n\nThe word \u015braddh\u0101, or \u201cfaith,\u201d is very significant in this verse. \u015araddh\u0101, or faith, originally comes out of the mode of goodness. One\u2019s faith may be in a demigod or some created God or some mental concoction. One\u2019s strong faith is supposed to be productive of works of material goodness. But in material conditional life, no works are completely purified. They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one\u2019s faith is not completely in purified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature, one\u2019s faith is established. It should be understood that if one\u2019s heart is in the mode of goodness his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is also thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but because the heart is tainted we find different types of religious principles. Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship."}, {"verse": "TEXT 4", "devanagari": "\u092f\u091c\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u093e\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0902\u0938\u093f \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0938\u093e: \u0964\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0924\u093e\u0928\u094d\u092d\u0942\u0924\u0917\u0923\u093e\u0902\u0936\u094d\u091a\u093e\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0947 \u092f\u091c\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0924\u093e\u092e\u0938\u093e \u091c\u0928\u093e: \u0965 \u096a \u0965", "verse-text": "yajante s\u0101ttvik\u0101 dev\u0101n\nyak\u1e63a-rak\u1e63\u0101\u1e41si r\u0101jas\u0101\u1e25\npret\u0101n bh\u016bta-ga\u1e47\u0101\u1e41\u015b c\u0101nye\nyajante t\u0101mas\u0101 jan\u0101\u1e25", "synonyms": "yajante \u2014 worship; s\u0101ttvik\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 those who are in the mode of goodness; dev\u0101n \u2014 demigods; yak\u1e63a-rak\u1e63\u0101\u1e41si \u2014 demons; r\u0101jas\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 those who are in the mode of passion; pret\u0101n \u2014 spirits of the dead; bh\u016bta-ga\u1e47\u0101n \u2014 ghosts; ca \u2014 and; anye \u2014 others; yajante \u2014 worship; t\u0101mas\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 in the mode of ignorance; jan\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 people.", "translation": "Men in the mode of goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode of passion worship the demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits.", "purport": "In this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds of worshipers according to their external activities. According to scriptural injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions worship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes of material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the demigods. The demigods include Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and others such as Indra, Candra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained.\n\nNow, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness. Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have seen that in India the lower-class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (4.3.23) it is said, sattva\u1e41 vi\u015buddha\u1e41 vasudeva-\u015babditam: \u201cWhen a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships V\u0101sudeva.\u201d The purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\nThe impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and they worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form in the material world, which is known as philosophized Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the impersonalists, because they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, imagine that the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form is just another aspect of the impersonal Brahman; similarly, they imagine that Lord Brahm\u0101 is the impersonal form in the material mode of passion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable, but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different qualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature."}, {"verse": "TEXTS 5-6", "devanagari": "\u0905\u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0939\u093f\u0924\u0902 \u0918\u094b\u0930\u0902 \u0924\u092a\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u092f\u0947 \u0924\u092a\u094b \u091c\u0928\u093e: \u0964\n\u0926\u092e\u094d\u092d\u093e\u0939\u0919\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0938\u0902\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e: \u0915\u093e\u092e\u0930\u093e\u0917\u092c\u0932\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e: \u0965 \u096b \u0965\n\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0937\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924: \u0936\u0930\u0940\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u092d\u0942\u0924\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e\u092e\u091a\u0947\u0924\u0938: \u0964\n\u092e\u093e\u0902 \u091a\u0948\u0935\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924: \u0936\u0930\u0940\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u0924\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0928\u093f\u0936\u094d\u091a\u092f\u093e\u0928\u094d \u0965 \u096c \u0965", "verse-text": "a\u015b\u0101stra-vihita\u1e41 ghora\u1e41\ntapyante ye tapo jan\u0101\u1e25\ndambh\u0101ha\u1e45k\u0101ra-sa\u1e41yukt\u0101\u1e25\nk\u0101ma-r\u0101ga-bal\u0101nvit\u0101\u1e25\n\nkar\u1e63ayanta\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bra-stha\u1e41\nbh\u016bta-gr\u0101mam acetasa\u1e25\nm\u0101\u1e41 caiv\u0101nta\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bra-stha\u1e41\nt\u0101n viddhy \u0101sura-ni\u015bcay\u0101n", "synonyms": "a\u015b\u0101stra \u2014 not in the scriptures; vihitam \u2014 directed; ghoram \u2014 harmful to others; tapyante \u2014 undergo; ye \u2014 those who; tapa\u1e25 \u2014 austerities; jan\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 persons; dambha \u2014 with pride; aha\u1e45k\u0101ra \u2014 and egoism; sa\u1e41yukt\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 engaged; k\u0101ma \u2014 of lust; r\u0101ga \u2014 and attachment; bala \u2014 by the force; anvit\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 impelled; kar\u1e63ayanta\u1e25 \u2014 tormenting; \u015bar\u012bra-stham \u2014 situated within the body; bh\u016bta-gr\u0101mam \u2014 the combination of material elements; acetasa\u1e25 \u2014 having a misled mentality; m\u0101m \u2014 Me; ca \u2014 also; eva \u2014 certainly; anta\u1e25 \u2014 within; \u015bar\u012bra-stham \u2014 situated in the body; t\u0101n \u2014 them; viddhi \u2014 understand; \u0101sura-ni\u015bcay\u0101n \u2014 demons.", "translation": "Those who undergo severe austerities and penances not recommended in the scriptures, performing them out of pride and egoism, who are impelled by lust and attachment, who are foolish and who torture the material elements of the body as well as the Supersoul dwelling within, are to be known as demons.", "purport": "There are persons who manufacture modes of austerity and penance which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions.

By such activities, not only is the combination of material elements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself living within the body. Such unauthorized fasting or austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others. They are not mentioned in the Vedic literature. A demoniac person may think that he can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. These acts are not approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those who engage in them are demons. Such demonstrations are insults to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the Vedic scriptural injunctions. The word acetasa\u1e25 is significant in this connection. Persons of normal mental condition must obey the scriptural injunctions. Those who are not in such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and penances. One should always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people, as described in the previous chapter. The Lord forces them to take birth in the wombs of demoniac persons. Consequently they will live by demoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities selected those foods that best aid health and increase life\u2019s duration, such as milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very dear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn and molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. All these foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable things like meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the killing of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk. Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split peas, d\u0101l, whole wheat, etc.\n\nFoods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by reducing the mucus in the stomach, leading to disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially those that are not fresh. Any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten (except pras\u0101dam, food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the mode of darkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness.\n\nRemnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was first offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially the spiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs, although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the remnants of what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of vegetables, flour and milk when offered with devotion. Patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toyam. Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts. But it is also mentioned that the pras\u0101dam should be prepared in a particular way. Any food prepared by the injunctions of the scripture and offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be taken even if prepared long, long ago, because such food is transcendental.

But whether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated by the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the Supreme \u2013 o\u1e41 tat sat, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal \u2013 they become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These three words, o\u1e41 tat sat, particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word o\u1e41 is always found.\n\nOne who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charity, sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the mode of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three words o\u1e41 tat sat are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g., o\u1e41 tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25. Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name of the Supreme Lord is uttered, o\u1e41 is added. This is the indication of Vedic literature. These three words are taken from Vedic hymns. O\u1e41 ity etad brahma\u1e47o nedi\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e41 n\u0101ma indicates the first goal. Then tat tvam asi (Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad 6.8.7) indicates the second goal. And sad eva saumya (Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad 6.2.1) indicates the third goal. Combined they become o\u1e41 tat sat. Formerly when Brahm\u0101, the first created living entity, performed sacrifices, he indicated by these three words the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the same principle has always been followed by disciplic succession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 recommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for o\u1e41 tat sat, or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity and sacrifice with these three words, he is acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to Godhead.

Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there can never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is advised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is the understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No one can obtain success without following this principle. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is the way to make everything successful.\n\nIn the conditional state, people are attracted to worshiping demigods, ghosts, or Yak\u1e63as like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and ignorance, but one who takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended in this chapter. To achieve success in this way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and receive training under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme. When that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities.

The Eighteenth Chapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed before. In every chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stresses that devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. This same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most confidential path of knowledge. In the first six chapters, stress was given to devotional service: yogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101m\u00a0\u2026 \u201cOf all yog\u012bs or transcendentalists, one who always thinks of Me within himself is best.\u201d In the next six chapters, pure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed. In the third six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental nature, and devotional service were described. It was concluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, represented by the words o\u1e41 tat sat, which indicate Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Person. The third part of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 has shown that devotional service, and nothing else, is the ultimate purpose of life. This has been established by citing past \u0101c\u0101ryas and the Brahma-s\u016btra, the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. Certain impersonalists consider themselves to have a monopoly on the knowledge of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, but actually the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra is meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord Himself is the composer of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, and He is its knower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every Veda, devotional service is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\nAs in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is given. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes of nature. Arjuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, namely renunciation (ty\u0101ga) and the renounced order of life (sanny\u0101sa). Thus he is asking the meaning of these two words.\n\nTwo words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord \u2013 H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba and Ke\u015bi-ni\u1e63\u016bdana \u2013 are significant. H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the master of all senses, who can always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize everything in such a way that he can remain equipoised. Yet he has some doubts, and doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Ke\u015bi-ni\u1e63\u016bdana. Ke\u015b\u012b was a most formidable demon who was killed by the Lord; now Arjuna is expecting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to kill the demon of doubt."}, {"verse": "TEXT 2", "devanagari": "\u0915\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0923\u093e\u0902 \u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0902 \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0902 \u0915\u0935\u092f\u094b \u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941: \u0964\n\u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u092b\u0932\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0917\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0917\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u091a\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093e: \u0965 \u0968 \u0965", "verse-text": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca\nk\u0101my\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 karma\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 ny\u0101sa\u1e41\nsanny\u0101sa\u1e41 kavayo vidu\u1e25\nsarva-karma-phala-ty\u0101ga\u1e41\npr\u0101hus ty\u0101ga\u1e41 vicak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101\u1e25", "synonyms": "\u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca \u2014 the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; k\u0101my\u0101n\u0101m \u2014 with desire; karma\u1e47\u0101m \u2014 of activities; ny\u0101sam \u2014 renunciation; sanny\u0101sam \u2014 the renounced order of life; kavaya\u1e25 \u2014 the learned; vidu\u1e25 \u2014 know; sarva \u2014 of all; karma \u2014 activities; phala \u2014 of results; ty\u0101gam \u2014 renunciation; pr\u0101hu\u1e25 \u2014 call; ty\u0101gam \u2014 renunciation; vicak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 the experienced.", "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The giving up of activities that are based on material desire is what great learned men call the renounced order of life [sanny\u0101sa].

The Supreme Lord is therefore the beginning of life of every living entity. And as stated in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Supreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and internal energy, is all-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His energies. Generally the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava devotees worship the Supreme Lord with His internal energy. His external energy is a perverted reflection of the internal energy. The external energy is a background, but the Supreme Lord by the expansion of His plenary portion as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is situated everywhere. He is the Supersoul of all demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One should therefore know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord one has his duty to render service unto the Supreme. Everyone should be engaged in devotional service to the Lord in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

If one thinks always in this way, in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then, by the grace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of everything. That is the perfection of life. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (12.7), te\u1e63\u0101m aha\u1e41 samuddhart\u0101. The Supreme Lord Himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee.

Duties prescribed according to one\u2019s nature are never affected by sinful reactions.", "purport": "One\u2019s occupational duty is prescribed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As already discussed in previous verses, the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra are prescribed according to their particular modes of nature. One should not imitate another\u2019s duty. A man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by \u015b\u016bdras should not artificially claim to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, although he may have been born into a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family. In this way one should work according to his own nature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the Supreme Lord. The occupational duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is certainly in the mode of goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should not imitate the occupational duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. For a k\u1e63atriya, or administrator, there are so many abominable things; a k\u1e63atriya has to be violent to kill his enemies, and sometimes a k\u1e63atriya has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy. Such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs, but a k\u1e63atriya is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a.\n\nOne should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya. He was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is performed for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there need be no fear of degradation. In the business field also, sometimes a merchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there can be no profit. Sometimes a merchant says, \u201cOh, my dear customer, for you I am making no profit,\u201d but one should know that without profit the merchant cannot exist. Therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not making a profit. But the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he should give up his profession and pursue the profession of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. That is not recommended. Whether one is a k\u1e63atriya, a vai\u015bya, or a \u015b\u016bdra doesn\u2019t matter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who perform different types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill animals because sometimes animals are sacrificed in such ceremonies. Similarly, if a k\u1e63atriya engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is no sin incurred. In the Third Chapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of Yaj\u00f1a, or for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anything done for personal sense gratification is a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord."}, {"verse": "TEXT 48", "devanagari": "\u0938\u0939\u091c\u0902 \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e \u0915\u094c\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947\u092f \u0938\u0926\u094b\u0937\u092e\u092a\u093f \u0928 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u091c\u0947\u0924\u094d \u0964\n\u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u092e\u094d\u092d\u093e \u0939\u093f \u0926\u094b\u0937\u0947\u0923 \u0927\u0942\u092e\u0947\u0928\u093e\u0917\u094d\u0928\u200d\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0935\u0943\u0924\u093e: \u0965 \u096a\u096e \u0965", "verse-text": "saha-ja\u1e41 karma kaunteya\nsa-do\u1e63am api na tyajet\nsarv\u0101rambh\u0101 hi do\u1e63e\u1e47a\ndh\u016bmen\u0101gnir iv\u0101v\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e25", "synonyms": "saha-jam \u2014 born simultaneously; karma \u2014 work; kaunteya \u2014 O son of Kunt\u012b; sa-do\u1e63am \u2014 with fault; api \u2014 although; na \u2014 never; tyajet \u2014 one should give up; sarva-\u0101rambh\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 all ventures; hi \u2014 certainly; do\u1e63e\u1e47a \u2014 with fault; dh\u016bmena \u2014 with smoke; agni\u1e25 \u2014 fire; iva \u2014 as; \u0101v\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 covered.", "translation": "Every endeavor is covered by some fault, just as fire is covered by smoke. Therefore one should not give up the work born of his nature, O son of Kunt\u012b, even if such work is full of fault.", "purport": "In conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature. Even if one is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he has to perform sacrifices in which animal killing is necessary. Similarly, a k\u1e63atriya, however pious he may be, has to fight enemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be, must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to do business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid them. Similarly, even though a man is a \u015b\u016bdra serving a bad master, he has to carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite these flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they are born out of his own nature.\n\nA very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is smoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is smoke in the fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one prefers to give up the work of a k\u1e63atriya and take up the occupation of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he is not assured that in the occupation of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a there are no unpleasant duties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be completely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one takes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts of the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing conditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because there are some disturbing elements.

Without being one with the Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot render service unto Him. In the absolute conception, there is no difference between the served and the servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher spiritual sense.\n\nIn the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification, there is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional service, there is no misery. The devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has nothing for which to lament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is engaged in God\u2019s service, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, becomes also full in himself. He is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no thought other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for any material loss or aspire for gain, because he is full in the service of the Lord. He has no desire for material enjoyment, because he knows that every living entity is a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does not see, in the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal value. This is the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, and this stage is attained very easily by the pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one\u2019s individuality becomes hellish, the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses are like serpents whose poison teeth are broken. As there is no fear of a serpent with broken teeth, there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically controlled. The world is miserable for the materially infected person, but for a devotee the entire world is as good as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, or the spiritual sky.

One should not mistakenly think that the word vi\u015bate, \u201centers into Me,\u201d supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous with the impersonal Brahman. No. Vi\u015bate means that one can enter into the abode of the Supreme Lord in one\u2019s individuality to engage in His association and render service unto Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. Impersonalists generally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This may be a source of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps his personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We find so many living entities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean is not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the ocean depths.\n\nBecause of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the transcendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it is stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one understand. The same is confirmed here; one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom.\n\nAfter attainment of the brahma-bh\u016bta stage of freedom from material conceptions, devotional service begins by one\u2019s hearing about the Lord. When one hears about the Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bh\u016bta stage develops, and material contamination \u2013 greediness and lust for sense enjoyment \u2013 disappears. As lust and desires disappear from the heart of a devotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such attachment he becomes free from material contamination. In that state of life he can understand the Supreme Lord. This is the statement of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also. After liberation the process of bhakti, or transcendental service, continues. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (4.1.12) confirms this: \u0101-pr\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101t tatr\u0101pi hi d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dam. This means that after liberation the process of devotional service continues. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, real devotional liberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own identity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is already explained: every living entity is a part-and-parcel fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore his constitutional position is to serve. After liberation, this service is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free from misconceptions of life."}, {"verse": "TEXT 56", "devanagari": "\u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923\u094d\u092f\u092a\u093f \u0938\u0926\u093e \u0915\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0923\u094b \u092e\u0926\u094d\u200d\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092a\u093e\u0936\u094d\u0930\u092f: \u0964\n\u092e\u0924\u094d\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0926\u0935\u093e\u092a\u094d\u200d\u0928\u094b\u0924\u093f \u0936\u093e\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0924\u0902 \u092a\u0926\u092e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092f\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u096b\u096c \u0965", "verse-text": "sarva-karm\u0101\u1e47y api sad\u0101\nkurv\u0101\u1e47o mad-vyap\u0101\u015braya\u1e25\nmat-pras\u0101d\u0101d av\u0101pnoti\n\u015b\u0101\u015bvata\u1e41 padam avyayam", "synonyms": "sarva \u2014 all; karm\u0101\u1e47i \u2014 activities; api \u2014 although; sad\u0101 \u2014 always; kurv\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25 \u2014 performing; mat-vyap\u0101\u015braya\u1e25 \u2014 under My protection; mat-pras\u0101d\u0101t \u2014 by My mercy; av\u0101pnoti \u2014 one achieves; \u015b\u0101\u015bvatam \u2014 the eternal; padam \u2014 abode; avyayam \u2014 imperishable.", "translation": "Though engaged in all kinds of activities, My pure devotee, under My protection, reaches the eternal and imperishable abode by My grace.", "purport": "The word mad-vyap\u0101\u015braya\u1e25 means under the protection of the Supreme Lord.

Just like a servant, one should act fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. A servant has no individual independence. He acts only on the order of the master. A servant acting on behalf of the supreme master is unaffected by profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms of the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue that Arjuna was acting under the personal direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not present how should one act? If one acts according to the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this book, as well as under the guidance of the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then the result will be the same. The Sanskrit word mat-para\u1e25 is very important in this verse. It indicates that one has no goal in life save and except acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness just to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And while working in that way, one should think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only: \u201cI have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d While acting in such a way, one naturally has to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should, however, note that after doing something whimsically he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of duty is not in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should act according to the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is a very important point. That order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master. Therefore the spiritual master\u2019s order should be taken as the prime duty of life.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He Himself, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the localized Supersoul, sits in the heart directing the living being. After changing bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but the Supersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness of all his activities. Therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by this Supersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the material body, which is created in the material energy under the direction of the Supersoul. As soon as a living entity is placed in a particular type of body, he has to work under the spell of that bodily situation. A person seated in a high-speed motorcar goes faster than one seated in a slower car, though the living entities, the drivers, may be the same. Similarly, by the order of the Supreme Soul, material nature fashions a particular type of body to a particular type of living entity so that he may work according to his past desires.

Now, in summarizing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord says that Arjuna should give up all the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him.\n\nIn the Seventh Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus one may think that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he is automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme savior of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.\n\nThe process of surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described in the Hari-bhakti-vil\u0101sa (11.676):\n\nAccording to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord. One may perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all his activities are in vain. Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will protect him from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one should keep the body and soul together. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will see to that. One should always think himself helpless and should consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the only basis for his progress in life. As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of material nature. There are different processes of religion and purificatory processes by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mystic yoga system, etc., but one who surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not have to execute so many methods. That simple surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will save him from unnecessarily wasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all sinful reactions.\n\nOne should be attracted by the beautiful vision of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. His name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful, all-powerful, omnipotent vision of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is fortunate. There are different kinds of transcendentalists \u2013 some of them are attached to the impersonal Brahman vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words, devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is the essence of the whole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.

He is meant for self-discipline. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says that the actual position of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in serving the Supreme Lord he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living entity\u2019s constitutional position is to be a servitor; he has to serve either the illusory m\u0101y\u0101 or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord he is in his normal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory, external energy, then certainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of m\u0101y\u0101 to trap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and agree to act according to His order.\n\nThe word moha is very important in this verse. Moha refers to that which is opposed to knowledge. Actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is eternally a servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that position, the living entity thinks that he is not a servant, that he is the master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature. That is his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is acting according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s order. A conditioned soul, illusioned by the external energy of matter, does not know that the Supreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything. Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the controller of this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the devotee. One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee, but a servitor of m\u0101y\u0101. Arjuna, however, after hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all illusion. He could understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not only his friend but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he understood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a factually. So to study Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a factually. When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally surrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When Arjuna understood that it was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to fight according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s desire. He again took up his weapons \u2013 his arrows and bow \u2013 to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."}, {"verse": "TEXT 74", "devanagari": "\u0907\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0939\u0902 \u0935\u093e\u0938\u0941\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0938\u094d\u092f \u091a \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0928: \u0964\n\u0938\u0902\u0935\u093e\u0926\u092e\u093f\u092e\u092e\u0936\u094d\u0930\u094c\u0937\u092e\u0926\u094d\u092d\u0941\u0924\u0902 \u0930\u094b\u092e\u0939\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0923\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u096d\u096a \u0965", "verse-text": "sa\u00f1jaya uv\u0101ca\nity aha\u1e41 v\u0101sudevasya\np\u0101rthasya ca mah\u0101tmana\u1e25\nsa\u1e41v\u0101dam imam a\u015brau\u1e63am\nadbhuta\u1e41 roma-har\u1e63a\u1e47am", "synonyms": "sa\u00f1jaya\u1e25 uv\u0101ca \u2014 Sa\u00f1jaya said; iti \u2014 thus; aham \u2014 I; v\u0101sudevasya \u2014 of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; p\u0101rthasya \u2014 and Arjuna; ca \u2014 also; mah\u0101-\u0101tmana\u1e25 \u2014 of the great soul; sa\u1e41v\u0101dam \u2014 discussion; imam \u2014 this; a\u015brau\u1e63am \u2014 have heard; adbhutam \u2014 wonderful; roma-har\u1e63a\u1e47am \u2014 making the hair stand on end.", "translation": "Sa\u00f1jaya said: Thus have I heard the conversation of two great souls, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna.

This means that one has to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not directly but through the medium of the spiritual master. The spiritual master is the transparent medium, although it is true that the experience is still direct. This is the mystery of the disciplic succession. When the spiritual master is bona fide, then one can hear Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 directly, as Arjuna heard it. There are many mystics and yog\u012bs all over the world, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all yoga systems. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instruction is explicitly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 \u2013 surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One who does so is the topmost yog\u012b. This is confirmed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Yogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101m.\n\nN\u0101rada is the direct disciple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the spiritual master of Vy\u0101sa. Therefore Vy\u0101sa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic succession, and Sa\u00f1jaya is the direct disciple of Vy\u0101sa. Therefore by the grace of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya\u2019s senses were purified, and he could see and hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly. One who directly hears K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can understand this confidential knowledge. If one does not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore his knowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is concerned.\n\nIn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, all the yoga systems \u2013 karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga \u2013 are explained. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all such mysticism. It is to be understood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly, so, by the grace of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya was also able to hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly. Actually there is no difference between hearing directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and hearing directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a via a bona fide spiritual master like Vy\u0101sa. The spiritual master is the representative of Vy\u0101sadeva also.

It is also predicted here that Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because not only was he righteous and pious but he was also a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life.\n\nThere are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to be a discussion of topics between two friends on a battlefield. But such a book cannot be scripture. Some may protest that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a incited Arjuna to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakta\u1e25. One must become a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). The instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the G\u012bt\u0101 is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.\n\nFrom Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge. But although the rituals of religion are confidential, meditation and cultivation of knowledge are still more confidential. And surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the most confidential instruction. That is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.\n\nAnother feature of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features \u2013 impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.\n\nIn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities. All is dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth \u2013 impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and any other transcendental conception \u2013 exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya\u2019s philosophy is that of \u201cinconceivable oneness and difference.\u201d This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.\n\nThe living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may be compared to the sun, and the living entities to sunshine. Because the living entities are the marginal energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they have a tendency to be in contact either with the material energy or with the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency."}], "desc": ""}, {"name": "A Note About the Second Edition", "link": "https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/note-2nd-edition/advanced-view", "verses": [], "desc": "For the benefit of readers who have become familiar with the first edition of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is, a few words about this second edition seem in order.\n\nAlthough in most respects the two editions are the same, the editors of the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust have gone back to the oldest manuscripts in their archives to make this second edition even more faithful to \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da\u2019s original work.\n\n\u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da finished Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is in 1967, two years after he came from India to America. The Macmillan Company published an abridged edition in 1968 and the first unabridged edition in 1972.\n\nThe new American disciples who helped \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da ready the manuscript for publication struggled with several difficulties. Those who transcribed his taped dictation sometimes found his heavily accented English hard to follow and his Sanskrit quotations strange to their ears. The Sanskrit editors had to do their best with a manuscript spotted with gaps and phonetic approximations. Yet their effort to publish \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da\u2019s work was a success, and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is has become the standard edition for scholars and devotees around the world.\n\nFor this second edition, however, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da\u2019s disciples had the benefit of having worked with his books for fifteen years. The English editors were familiar with his philosophy and language, and the Sanskrit editors were by now accomplished scholars. And now they were able to see their way through perplexities in the manuscript by consulting the same Sanskrit commentaries \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da consulted when writing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is.\n\nThe result is a work of even greater richness and authenticity. The word-for-word Sanskrit-English equivalents now follow more closely the standard of \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da\u2019s other books and are therefore more clear and precise. In places the translations, though already correct, have been revised to come closer to the original Sanskrit and to \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da\u2019s original dictation. In the Bhaktivedanta purports, many passages lost to the original edition have been restored to their places. And Sanskrit quotations whose sources were unnamed in the first edition now appear with full references to chapter and verse.\n\nThe Publishers"}]}]
